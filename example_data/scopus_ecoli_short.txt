Background: A few recent large efforts significantly expanded the collection of human-associated bacterial genomes, which now contains thousands of entities including reference complete/draft genomes and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). These genomes provide useful resource for studying the functionality of the human-associated microbiome and their relationship with human health and diseases. One application of these genomes is to provide a universal reference for database search in metaproteomic studies, when matched metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data are unavailable. However, a greater collection of reference genomes may not necessarily result in better peptide/protein identification because the increase of search space often leads to fewer spectrum-peptide matches, not to mention the drastic increase of computation time. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.] Methods: Here, we present a new approach that uses two steps to optimize the use of the reference genomes and MAGs as the universal reference for human gut metaproteomic MS/MS data analysis. The first step is to use only the high-abundance proteins (HAPs) (i.e., ribosomal proteins and elongation factors) for metaproteomic MS/MS database search and, based on the identification results, to derive the taxonomic composition of the underlying microbial community. The second step is to expand the search database by including all proteins from identified abundant species. We call our approach HAPiID (HAPs guided metaproteomics IDentification). Results: We tested our approach using human gut metaproteomic datasets from a previous study and compared it to the state-of-the-art reference database search method MetaPro-IQ for metaproteomic identification in studying human gut microbiota. Our results show that our two-steps method not only performed significantly faster but also was able to identify more peptides. We further demonstrated the application of HAPiID to revealing protein profiles of individual human-associated bacterial species, one or a few species at a time, using metaproteomic data. Conclusions: The HAP guided profiling approach presents a novel effective way for constructing target database for metaproteomic data analysis. The HAPiID pipeline built upon this approach provides a universal tool for analyzing human gut-associated metaproteomic data.	Stamboulian M.|Li S.|Ye Y.

Monoterpenes (C10 isoprenoids) are the main components of essential oils and are possible precursors for many commodity chemicals and high energy density fuels. Monoterpenes are synthesized from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), which is also the precursor for the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FPP biosynthesis diverts the carbon flux from monoterpene production to C15 products and quinone biosynthesis. In this study, we tested a chromosomal mutation of Escherichia coli's native FPP synthase (IspA) to improve GPP availability for the production of monoterpenes using a heterologous mevalonate pathway. Monoterpene production at high levels required not only optimization of GPP production but also a basal level of FPP to maintain growth. The optimized strains produced two jet fuel precursor monoterpenoids 1,8-cineole and linalool at the titer of 653 mg/L and 505 mg/L, respectively, in batch cultures with 1% glucose. The engineered strains developed in this work provide useful resources for the production of high-value monoterpenes. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 1703–1712. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The reliable identification and analysis of the low abundance proteins expressed by a cell remains a key challenge in the study of cellular proteomes. The analysis of low abundance proteins is a particular problem when using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to resolve the cellular proteins since the technology is unable to display the wide dynamic range of protein levels typically synthesized by cells. We have investigated the use of reactive dye compounds for the enrichment of low abundance cellular proteins prior to analysis by 2-DE. The capacity of reactive dye compounds to bind specific protein species was used as the basis for a general chromatographic tool for protein enrichment. Six reactive dye compounds were investigated in detail for the analysis of Escherichia coli proteins. Whole bacterial cell lysates were passed down columns prepared with the reactive dye compounds. The bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 M NaCl and analyzed by 2-DE. Distinctive protein profiles were observed for the bound proteins recovered from the different reactive dye compounds. Selected proteins enriched by these methods were identified by peptide mass mapping. The enrichment procedure developed using reactive dye compounds were used to investigate acid-induced changes in the proteome of E. coli grown at either pH 7.0 or pH 5.8. Increased levels of expression were observed for a number of proteins (for example, GdhA, PanC, ProC, TkrA, EF-TS and YodA) were observed for E. coli grown at pH 5.8. Five identified proteins (AroG, FabI, GlyA, PurA and EF-Tu) showed reduced levels of synthesis for bacteria grown at pH 5.8 compared to pH 7.0. In the case of PanC and Fabl the altered expression profiles were only reliably demonstrated using the enrichment protocols. One theme emerging from these data was that the expression of proteins concerned with one-carbon metabolism was perturbed at pH 5.8, which may point to a previously unrecognized affect of low pH stress on the physiology of E. coli cells. We conclude that the prefractionation of cell lysates on reactive dye columns will serve as a valuable generic tool for the analysis of low abundance proteins expressed by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) at an acceptable false discovery rate (FDR) is challenging. Previously we identified several hundred PPIs from affinity purification - mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data for the bacteria Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris. These two interactomes have lower FDRs than any of the nine interactomes proposed previously for bacteria and are more enriched in PPIs validated by other data than the nine earlier interactomes. To more thoroughly determine the accuracy of ours or other interactomes and to discover further PPIs de novo, here we present a quantitative tagless method that employs iTRAQ MS to measure the copurification of endogenous proteins through orthogonal chromatography steps. 5273 fractions from a four-step fractionation of a D. vulgaris protein extract were assayed, resulting in the detection of 1242 proteins. Protein partners from our D. vulgaris and E. coli AP-MS interactomes copurify as frequently as pairs belonging to three benchmark data sets of well-characterized PPIs. In contrast, the protein pairs from the nine other bacterial interactomes copurify two- to 20-fold less often. We also identify 200 high confidence D. vulgaris PPIs based on tagless copurification and colocalization in the genome. These PPIs are as strongly validated by other data as our AP-MS interactomes and overlap with our AP-MS interactome for D.vulgaris within 3% of expectation, once FDRs and false negative rates are taken into account. Finally, we reanalyzed data from two quantitative tagless screens of human cell extracts. We estimate that the novel PPIs reported in these studies have an FDR of at least 85% and find that less than 7% of the novel PPIs identified in each screen overlap. Our results establish that a quantitative tagless method can be used to validate and identify PPIs, but that such data must be analyzed carefully to minimize the FDR.
