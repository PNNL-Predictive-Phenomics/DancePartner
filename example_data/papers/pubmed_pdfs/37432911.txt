To efficiently extract biomolecules of different physicochemical properties,  preparation of various sample type needs specific tailoring, especially of difficult ones, such  as C. elegans. In this study we sought to develop a multi-omics sample preparation method  starting with a single set of C. elegans samples to save time, minimize variability, expand  biomolecule coverage, and promote multi-omics integration. We investigated tissue disruption  methods to effectively release biomolecules and optimized extraction strategies to achieve broader  and more reproducible biomolecule coverage in proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics  workflows. In our assessment we also considered speediness and usability of the approaches.  The developed method was validated through a study of 16 C. elegans samples designed to shine  light on mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), induced by three unique stressors -  knocking down electron transfer chain element cco-1, mitochondrial ribosome protein S5 mrps-5,  and antibiotic treatment Doxycycline. Our findings suggested that the method achieved great  coverage of proteome, lipidome, and metabolome with high reproducibility and validated that  *Corresponding Author: Joshua J.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptall stressors triggered UPRmt in C. elegans, although generating unique molecular signatures.  Innate immune response was activated, and triglycerides were decreased under all three stressor  conditions. Additionally, Doxycycline treatment elicited more distinct proteomic, lipidomics, and  metabolomic response than the other two treatments. Our method can also be adapted to other  organisms for multi-omics research. Omics research entails the global identification and quantification of molecules in a  biological matrix and multi-omics is the integration of multiple -omic datasets1–5. By  leveraging accurate quantitative data, multi-omics can capture holistic snapshots of different  molecular layers and offer multiple perspectives in examination of complex biological  systems. Researchers usually extract nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and/or small molecules  from separate sets of samples for transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics/metabolomics,  respectively2–5. Splitting samples for processing with multiple downstream methods has the  potential to increase technical variances6, require a greater sample amount, and consume  time. Extracting multiple types of biomolecules from a single set of samples would be  desirable, especially when working with limited amounts of material. The soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has been widely used  as a model organism to study various biological processes, such as development, aging,  neurodegeneration, stress response, and pathogenic immune response among many others7.  Thick cuticles on the worms, however, make extraction of biomolecules from them a  non-trivial task. These cuticles are made of layers of highly structured and cross-linked  collagen and other insoluble proteins, covered with layers of lipid-rich and glycoprotein- rich materials8. Effective disruption of the worm tissue is key to deep and reproducible  analyses, and diverse approaches have been applied to achieve it8–10. For example, Geier  et al. evaluated six methods including manual grinding, homogenizing, and bead beating  with two extraction solvents. They found that bead beating and manual grinding, but not  homogenizing, was comparable to obtaining good metabolome coverage9. Another important consideration for multi-omics studies is the solvents used for extraction.  Commonly used solvent-based methods can be broadly categorized into two major  subgroups: biphasic and monophasic – depending on whether the solvents form one miscible  phase or two incompatible phases when extracting molecules. The classic biphasic method  is the Folch, or Bligh and Dyer method that uses a combination of chloroform, methanol  (MeOH) and water11,12. Matyash et al. adopted the use of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE),  instead of potentially carcinogenic chloroform13, in combination with MeOH and water, and  the resulting approach has become the mainstream method to extract proteins, lipids, and  polar metabolites14. However, three solvents are dispensed into samples separately with this  method, which adds liquid handling steps and is not optimal for large-scale studies. One  modified Matyash method used two solvent mixtures instead of three solvents, and has been  applied to extract proteins, lipids, and polar metabolites from green algae15. Due to the limited ability to simultaneously extract polar and apolar compounds, single  phase extraction strategies are often specifically designed for metabolomics or lipidomics  analyses16–18. For example, MeOH/water-based extraction of polar metabolites has been  commonly applied for metabolomics studies19. The MAW method, which incorporates  Zhu et al. Page 2 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptMeOH, acetonitrile (ACN), and water, exhibited improved extraction efficiencies for plant  metabolome20. Another mono-phasic method with n-Butanol/MeOH can extract lipids  effectively21. Muehlbauer et al. used a combination of n-Butanol, ACN, and water (BAW)  to extract both lipids and polar metabolites22. Various extraction methods exist for omics  research, but so far, no comprehensive evaluation of these extraction methods is available for  multi-omics research of C. elegans. Here we aim to establish a tissue disruption and extraction method that is compatible with  large-scale multi-omics research using a single set of C. elegans samples. To achieve this  goal, we benchmarked freeze-thaw, bead beating, bath sonication, and combinations of  multiple methods to disrupt worm tissues. To generate broad and reproducible biomolecule  coverage across proteome, lipidome, and metabolome, we compared different extraction  strategies, including two mono-phasic methods (BAW and MAW) and two biphasic methods  (the original Matyash (OriMat) and the modified version with two solvent mixtures  (ModMat). Protein yield, protein/lipid/metabolite coverage, and method reproducibility  were used as the evaluation metrics. Extraction efficiency was also assessed by spiking in  isotopically labeled standards. Having established that bead-beating and ModMat extraction  afforded the best performance, we applied the developed workflow to a biological study of  mitochondrial function in C. elegans. Mitochondria act as the energy hub and mediate signaling pathways for various biological  functions23 with the majority of the mitochondrial proteome comprising nuclear-gene  encoded proteins imported into the mitochondria24,25. When the mito-nuclear protein  balance is perturbed, a cascade of signaling events is triggered to restore the equilibrium  and such stress response is termed mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt)26.  Knocking down electron transfer component (ETC) gene cco-1 (encoding cytochrome c  oxidase-1 subunit Vb/COX4) and mrps-5 (encoding mitochondrial ribosome protein S5,  MRPS-5) induces UPR(mt)24,26. Doxycycline (Dox) given throughout life dose-dependently  also induces UPRmt in worms24 and alters the proteomic and lipidomic landscape2. Here we  performed multi-omics profiling of biomolecular changes associated with UPRmt in worms  triggered by these three stressors and revealed molecular commonalities and discrepancies of  UPRmt induced by them. EXPERIMENTAL Materials: All chemicals and solvents were of LCMS grade and the list of materials can be found in  Supporting information. Worm Preparation: N2 worms were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°C until use. Approximately  1700 worms were allotted as one sample for method development experiments. Worms  treated with RNAi or Dox were prepared as described previously27, see also Supporting  information. Zhu et al. Page 3 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25.

To lyse C. elegans, one or more of the following methods was used: (1) three rounds of  flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing on ice, (2) bead-beating for 5 min at 4°C,  (3) bath sonication for 5 min at 0°C. For OriMat, these steps were performed prior to  addition of water and after tissue disruption, water was added to complete the OriMat.  For ModMat, tissue disruption was done either before or after adding M2. Additional 30  s of vortexing was done for OriMat and ModMat. All samples were centrifuged for 10  min at 12,500 g at 4°C. Upper organic phase or monophasic extract, was dried by vacuum  centrifugation for lipidomics analysis. Lower aqueous phase or monophasic extract was  dried for metabolomics analysis. Precipitated proteins were digested for proteomics, see also  Supporting information. Proteomics: Peptides were resuspended in 0.2% formic acid in water and were separated on an in- house prepared high pressure reversed phase C18 column approximately28 (See Supporting  information). The column was installed onto a Thermo Ultimate 3000 nano LC and heated  to 50 °C for all runs. Eluting peptide fragments were ionized by electrospray ionization  and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Eclipse. LC-MS files were searched in MaxQuant  (v2.0.3.1)29. Potential contaminant proteins, protein groups that contain proteins identified  with decoy peptide sequence, and those identified only with modification sites were  removed. LFQ intensities after missing value imputation were used as the quantification  metric. Lipidomics: Extracted lipids were resuspended with 100 μL 9:1 MeOH:Toluene and were separated  on an ACQUITY CSH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 μm, Waters) at 50°C.  The LC system (Vanquish Binary Pump, Thermo Scientific) was coupled to a Q Exactive  Orbitrap through a heated electrospray ionization (HESI II) source (Thermo Scientific). For  Zhu et al.

LC-MS files were processed using Compound  Discoverer 3.3 (Thermo Scientific). The profiles were filtered based on a few criteria.  MS/MS spectra were searched against multiple spectrum libraries. The resulting features  were filtered based on the peak quality rating. Targeted analysis was done in Skyline  (v21.1.0.278)31 to quantify the amino acid standards. Details about instrument parameters  and data processing for three omes can be found in the Supporting Information. Data analysis—Data analysis was performed in RStudio (Version 1.3.959)32 and  visualization was done with ggplot package33. ANOV A followed by Tukey HSD test  was done and adjusted p values from Tukey HSD test were used to indicate statistical  significance. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To develop effective multi-omics methods with a single set of C. elegans samples, we  investigated various tissue disruption techniques to release biomolecules and assessed  extraction methods to extract them. Peptide yield, number of extracted biomolecules, and  reproducibility (intra-replicate variance) were used as evaluation metrics. Tissue disruption method evaluation We performed three tissue disruption techniques, including flash-freezing, bead-beating,  and bath-sonication as well as combinations of two or three of these methods (Fig. 1A).  Shotgun proteomics, discovery lipidomics, and discovery metabolomics analyses were  carried out to assess methods’ effectiveness. In addition, the number of steps and the  time each method requires were evaluated as a highly relevant consideration, especially  for large-scale studies. The peptide yields of different tissue disruption methods (Fig.  1B) were similar except for the combination of flash-freezing and bead-beating which  yielded less peptide mass than bath sonication, the highest yielding method. Regarding the  number of peptides detected using LC-MS/MS analysis, all methods were again similar  with only flash-freezing in combination with bead-beating producing a slightly smaller but  significantly different number of peptides than bead-beating alone (Fig. 1B). Examination  of the number of features/identified biomolecules and variance in their abundance across  technical replicates suggested that all methods afforded detection of the same number  of proteins, lipids, and metabolites (Supplemental Table S1). However, bead-beating and  bead-beating in combination with sonication generated the most reproducible quantification  of biomolecules across all three omes (Fig. 1C). The measurements obtained using flash- freezing exhibited highest variances across all types of biomolecules, which could be  Zhu et al. Page 5 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptexplained by insufficient tissue disruption and extraction achieved by this method. Among  all methods, bath-sonication was the simplest and most efficient to perform, followed by  bead-beating, and flash-freezing (Fig. 1D). In summary, bead beating was the most reproducible tissue disruption method for C.  elegans with good peptide yield, high numbers of detected molecules, lowest intra-replicate  variances across three omes, and reasonable time spent, and steps involved. Combinations  of agitating methods did not bring in extra benefits. Of note, flash-freezing alone should  be avoided when other methods are available. In this study, bead-beating was adopted for  downstream assessment. Extraction strategy evaluation Having determined the best approach to disrupt and lyse C. elegans samples, we next  sought to evaluate various methods to extract the biomolecules. To do this we assessed  two monophasic methods, BAW and MAW, and two biphasic methods, OriMat and  ModMat (Fig. 2A). We first examined the number of biomolecules extracted with the  four methods (Supplemental Table 2) and found that all the methods generated comparable  numbers of detected proteins. However, the BAW method produced a significantly lower  number of metabolite identifications, and MAW generated significantly lower numbers of  both lipid and polar metabolite features as compared with biphasic methods. Given that  MAW was originally developed for studies of polar metabolites20, it is not surprising that  MAW was not efficient at extracting lipids. The two biphasic methods afforded the same  depth in proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics analyses. We also interrogated lipid  class composition (Fig. 2B) and the results revealed that mono-phasic methods efficiently  extracted polar acyl-carnitines (AC) – a finding that could be attributed to the more polar  solvent compositions in these methods. MAW was expectedly less effective in extracting all  major lipid classes. The other three methods did not show great differences in extracting  glycerolipids (GL) or sphingolipids (SL). ModMat was slightly less effective in extracting  glycerophospholipids (GPL). Next, we assessed reproducibility of the four methods by examining the intra-replicate  variances in biomolecule quantification across the three omes (Fig. 2C). Little differences  in RSD distribution of protein groups were observed, and all methods achieved low median  RSD values below 10%. MAW extraction resulted in the worst lipid feature RSD distribution  with the median RSD over 30%. For metabolite features, reproducibility of mono-phasic  methods was worse than that of the two biphasic methods, and ModMat performed best with  the lowest median RSD of 12.9%. To assess extraction efficiency, 10uL SPLASH lipid standards covering 12 lipid classes  and 13C amino acid isotope mixture containing 20 amino acids were spiked into the  samples. We then checked the intensities of the lipid and amino acid standards measured  in lipidomics and metabolomics workflow, respectively. For the lipid standards, the detected  signals were not significantly different between BAW and OriMat, and ModMat and OriMat.  Not surprisingly, MAW had significantly lower extraction efficiencies for more hydrophobic  molecules, such as phosphatidic acid (PA) 15:0_18:1, triglyceride (TG) 15:0_18:1_15:0, and  cholesterol ester (CE) 18:1 (Fig. 2D). Results also indicated that extraction methods had  Zhu et al. Page 6 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptminimal effect on heavy amino acid intensities: the log2 fold change (FC) of intensity was  negligible and the differences had no statistical significance after Benjamini & Hochberg  (FDR correction) (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The four methods did not differ considerably  in the RSD values of lipid and amino acid standards, or intensities of polar metabolites  (Supplemental Fig. S1B and C). To summarize, the four extraction methods performed similarly for downstream  proteomic analysis. However, MAW was less efficient at extracting lipids and had  worse reproducibility than the biphasic methods, and BAW resulted in fewer metabolite  identifications. ModMat and OriMat method were overall comparable across three omes but  ModMat was easier to implement, especially for large-scale studies. Therefore, ModMat was  chosen to be applied for further analysis. After developing the multi-omics method, we also evaluated a more streamlined ModMat by  doing tissue disruption after adding both solvent mixtures. The potential drawback could be  that tissue disruption would be less effective in a colloid-like system. However, the results  suggested that doing tissue disruption after adding both solvents did not affect the extraction  significantly. We further evaluated extraction volume for the ModMat method and observed  that increasing extraction volumes did not bring in extra benefits (Supplemental Fig. S2 and  S3, Supplemental Table S2 and S3). Method Validation Having concluded bead beating and ModMat method was best for tissue disruption and  extraction respectively, we next used this strategy to profile the biomolecular signatures  of UPRmt induced by cco-1 RNAi, mrps-5 RNAi, and Dox treatment (Fig. 3A). In total,  we detected and quantified 6,313 proteins, 5,320 lipid features (558 identified) and 1,640  metabolite features (98 identified). The RSD distributions of features across three omes  were low (Supplemental Fig. S4) with median protein RSDs below 10% and lipid and  metabolite feature (after filtering with instrument QC RSD) RSDs below 20%. These results  demonstrated that the methods can provide a foundation from which to produce high quality  multi-omics data. To confirm the knockdowns were effective, we first analyzed the proteomic data for the  abundances of COX4 and MRPS-5 (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that the RNAi was  successful in knocking down cco-1 and mrps-5. mrps-5 knockdown and Dox treatment  also significantly, but to a lesser extent, decreased COX4 expression. We then checked  the abundance of UPRmt marker heat shock protein 6 (HSP6) and heat shock protein  60 (HSP60) to check whether UPRmt was activated. As a result, abundances of HSP6  and HSP60 were significantly increased by the three treatments but to differing degrees,  suggesting that UPRmt was activated differentially by the three generated significantly  different molecular signatures (Fig. 3C). Protein PCA showed that cco-1 and mrps-5 RNAi  groups clustered together, suggesting that the knockdown of the two genes similarly affected  the proteome profiles. Meanwhile, Dox treated samples deviated away from cco-1 and  mrps-5 RNAi groups, implying a unique proteomic signature of this treatment. Interestingly,  the clustering patterns of the four treatments and Dox was less potent than the gene  knockdown treatments in doing so. As expected, the Dox level measured with metabolomics  Zhu et al. Page 7 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptworkflow was significantly higher in the Dox-treated samples. These results validated our  study approach and multi-omics analysis workflow. Abundance levels of thousands of biomolecules were disturbed by the three treatments  (Supplemental Fig. S5). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that three treatments  groups at the lipidome and metabolome levels resembled each other. In addition, the  lipidome and metabolome of cco-1 and mrps-5 RNAi groups were more divergent from  each other than proteome, suggesting metabolite and lipid abundances can divert despite  the similar proteomic landscape. Dox treatment again generated a distinct lipid/metabolome  signature from the other two groups. To categorize the changes induced by three treatments, we performed GO term enrichment  analysis of 5,895 proteins, which passed missing value filtering, and lipid class enrichment  analysis of 4,315 lipid features with instrument QC RSD < 30%. Differentially expressed  proteins for each treatment used in the enrichment analysis were proteins that had a log2 FC  > 0 or < 0 compared with the controls, and the change was statistically significant with FDR  adjusted p value < 0.05. The same rule was applied to lipid class enrichment analysis. The  complete list of GO term enrichment analysis results can be found in Supplemental Table  S5. The enrichment analysis verified the ample resemblance between cco-1 and mrps-5  RNAi treatment, and more discrepancies induced by Dox treatment (Fig. 4). For the top  10 stimulated Biological Processes (BP), cco-1 and mrps-5 RNAi treatment shared seven  of them. Meanwhile, Dox treatment resulted in much less overlap with either of the RNAi  treatments. The only commonly shared BP among the three stress conditions was Innate  Immune Response (IIR). IIR has been reported to be triggered upon UPRmt activation2  with Dox treatment and IIR stimulation in three treatment conditions underscored the  common linkage between the innate immunity and mitochondrial dysfunction in worms.  The differential expression of the 106 IIR proteins in three treatment groups can be found in  Supplemental Table S6. Four repressed BPs related to translation, and ribosome biogenesis  and assembly were shared between cco-1 and mrps-5 RNAi group. Dox treatment elicited  a different repertoire of repressed BPs than cco-1 RNAi but shared three BPs with mrps-5  RNAi. No commonly shared suppressed BP existed among the three treatments (Fig. 4B). Lipid class enrichment analysis suggested that no increased lipid class was observed for any  of the three treatments. Dox treatment exerted a broad inhibitory effect on multiple lipid  classes, including TG, PE, PC, PC(OH), and Cer[NS]. cco-1 RNAi reduced the abundance  of TG, Cer[NS], and PC. Meanwhile, mrps-5 RNAi affected only TG (Supplemental Fig.  S6A). TG was the only commonly decreased lipid class among the three treatments. Dox  treatment reduced the abundance of TGs in worm N2 and CB4856 strain2, and the same  changes of TGs in the two gene knockdown groups implied a conserved feature of UPRmt  in worms induced by different stressors. The top 50 metabolites that contributed to the  separation of four conditions included five identified ones: acetyl-carnitine, L-arginine,  L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, and trans-3-indoleacrylic acid (Supplemental Fig. 6B).  The intensity profiles of the five metabolites in three treatment groups were significantly  different (Supplemental Fig. S6C). To further integrate multi-omics data, a cross-ome  correlation between 106 IIR proteins and identified lipids/metabolites was performed  (Supplemental Fig. S6D). We observed highly correlated protein and lipid/metabolite pairs.  Zhu et al. Page 8 Anal Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 July 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe tight correlation between proteins, and lipids/metabolites underlined the utility of  performing multi-omics analysis to capture those connections. Upon further investigation,  such correlations could help better understand UPRmt. CONCLUSION Mass spectrometry based multi-omics is a powerful tool for capturing biochemical  underpinnings of changes in biological systems. Nonetheless, it faces many challenges  from sample preparation, instrumental implementation all the way to data analysis. Here  we developed and optimized a multi-omics sample preparation method using a single set  of worm samples to save time and reduce variances, especially for large-scale studies.  Specifically, we evaluated tissue disruption methods, including bead-beating, flash-freezing  in liquid nitrogen, and bath-sonication as well as combinations of multiple methods to break  worm tissues and release biomolecules. We found that bead-beating was most reproducible  with high numbers of detected biomolecules, reasonable time spent, and steps involved.  Then, we assessed four extraction strategies, including both mono-phasic (BAW and MAW)  and biphasic methods (OriMat and ModMat) to extract biomolecules across proteome,  lipidome, and metabolome. As a result, the biphasic method ModMat was optimal in  terms of numbers of detected biomolecules and reproducibility. We further streamlined  the ModMat method to suit large-scale studies. After optimizing the tissue disruption and  extraction method, we tested the applicability of our method to study biological questions.  Our approach produced high quality data with deep profiling and good reproducibility  across the three omes. Our method proved applicable to study mitochondrial stress response,  recapitulating known aspects of this process as well as revealing novel insights. Finally,  we note this multi-omics method can be readily adapted to studies of other organisms. The  future improvement could be to enable the extraction of RNA molecules to incorporate  transcriptomics into the multi-omics workflow.
