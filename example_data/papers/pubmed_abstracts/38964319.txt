C. elegans touch receptor neurons direct mechanosensory complex organization via repurposing conserved basal lamina proteins. The sense of touch is conferred by the conjoint function of somatosensory neurons and skin cells. These cells meet across a gap filled by a basal lamina, an ancient structure found in metazoans. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigate the composition and ultrastructure of the extracellular matrix at the epidermis and touch receptor neuron (TRN) interface. We show that membrane-matrix complexes containing laminin, nidogen, and the MEC-4 mechano-electrical transduction channel reside at this interface and are central to proper touch sensation. Interestingly, the dimensions and spacing of these complexes correspond with the discontinuous beam-like extracellular matrix structures observed in serial-section transmission electron micrographs. These complexes fail to coalesce in touch-insensitive extracellular matrix mutants and in dissociated neurons. Loss of nidogen reduces the density of mechanoreceptor complexes and the amplitude of the touch-evoked currents they carry. Thus, neuron-epithelium cell interfaces are instrumental in mechanosensory complex assembly and function. Unlike the basal lamina ensheathing the pharynx and body wall muscle, nidogen recruitment to the puncta along TRNs is not dependent upon laminin binding. MEC-4, but not laminin or nidogen, is destabilized by point mutations in the C-terminal Kunitz domain of the extracellular matrix component, MEC-1. These findings imply that somatosensory neurons secrete proteins that actively repurpose the basal lamina to generate special-purpose mechanosensory complexes responsible for vibrotactile sensing.
