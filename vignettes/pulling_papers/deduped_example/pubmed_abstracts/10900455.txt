Yeast two-hybrid systems and protein interaction mapping projects for yeast and worm. The availability of complete genome sequences necessitates the development of standardized functional assays to analyse the tens of thousands of predicted gene products in high-throughput experimental settings. Such approaches are collectively referred to as 'functional genomics'. One approach to investigate the properties of a proteome of interest is by systematic analysis of protein-protein interactions. So far, the yeast two-hybrid system is the most commonly used method for large-scale, high-throughput identification of potential protein-protein interactions. Here, we discuss several technical features of variants of the two-hybrid systems in light of data recently obtained from different protein interaction mapping projects for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
