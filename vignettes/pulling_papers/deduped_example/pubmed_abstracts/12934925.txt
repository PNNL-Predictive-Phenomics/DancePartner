Probing the molecular physiology of the microbial organism, Escherichia coli using proteomics. Genomics and proteomics technologies have yielded volumes of data for more than 20 years, and they continues to produce data at an astounding rate. Has all of this data helped us understand more about life, or it is just bogging us down in details that cannot be assembled into meaningful ideas? This review of the proteomics efforts over the last couple of decades is meant to emphasize that a new scientific discipline has emerged, Molecular Physiology, and that, indeed, this discipline is contributing to our understanding of life. Molecular physiology offers the reductionisms details of individual cellular molecules and offers the systems biology multivariant and high-dimensional datasets of cellular molecules.
