Citrullination is a post-translational modification (PTM) of arginine that is crucial for several physiological processes, including gene regulation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Despite recent advances, studies of protein citrullination remain challenging due to the difficulty of accessing proteins homogeneously citrullinated at a specific site. Herein, we report a technology that enables the site-specific incorporation of citrulline (Cit) into proteins in mammalian cells. This approach exploits an engineered E. coli-derived leucyl tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair that incorporates a photocaged-citrulline (SM60) into proteins in response to a nonsense codon. Subsequently, SM60 is readily converted to Cit with light in vitro and in living cells. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we biochemically characterize the effect of incorporating Cit at two known autocitrullination sites in Protein Arginine Deiminase 4 (PAD4, R372 and R374) and show that the R372Cit and R374Cit mutants are 181- and 9-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. This technology possesses the potential to decipher the biology of citrullination.	Mondal S.|Wang S.|Zheng Y.|Sen S.|Chatterjee A.|Thompson P.R.

Francisella tularensis is one of the most virulent pathogenic bacteria causing the acute human respiratory disease tularemia. While the mechanisms underlying F. tularensis pathogenesis are largely unknown, previous studies have shown that a F. novicida transposon mutant with insertions in a gene coding for a putative lysine decarboxylase was attenuated in mouse spleen, suggesting a possible role of its protein product as a virulence factor. Therefore, we set out to structurally and functionally characterize the F. novicida lysine decarboxylase, which we termed LdcF. Here, we investigate the genetic environment of ldcF as well as its evolutionary relationships with other basic AAT-fold amino acid decarboxylase superfamily members, known as key actors in bacterial adaptative stress response and polyamine biosynthesis. We determine the crystal structure of LdcF and compare it with the most thoroughly studied lysine decarboxylase, E. coli LdcI. We analyze the influence of ldcF deletion on bacterial growth under different stress conditions in dedicated growth media, as well as in infected macrophages, and demonstrate its involvement in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, our mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis enables identification of 80 proteins with expression levels significantly affected by ldcF deletion, including several DNA repair proteins potentially involved in the diminished capacity of the F. novicida mutant to deal with oxidative stress. Taken together, we uncover an important role of LdcF in F. novicida survival in host cells through participation in oxidative stress response, thereby singling out this previously uncharacterized protein as a potential drug target.

Background: Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the principal pathogen that causes biofilm formation. Biofilms are associated with infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. This study employed proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins after coculture of E. coli with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) microcapsules. Methods: To explore the relevant protein abundance changes after E. coli and LGG coculture, label-free quantitative proteomic analysis and qRT-PCR were applied to E. coli and LGG microcapsule groups before and after coculture, respectively. Results: The proteomic analysis characterised a total of 1655 proteins in E. coli K12MG1655 and 1431 proteins in the LGG. After coculture treatment, there were 262 differentially expressed proteins in E. coli and 291 in LGG. Gene ontology analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were mainly related to cellular metabolism, the stress response, transcription and the cell membrane. A protein interaction network and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the differentiated proteins were mainly involved in the protein ubiquitination pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: These findings indicated that LGG microcapsules may inhibit E. coli biofilm formation by disrupting metabolic processes, particularly in relation to energy metabolism and stimulus responses, both of which are critical for the growth of LGG. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the interactions between bacteria under coculture conditions.	Song H.|Lou N.|Liu J.|Xiang H.|Shang D.

Background: A few recent large efforts significantly expanded the collection of human-associated bacterial genomes, which now contains thousands of entities including reference complete/draft genomes and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). These genomes provide useful resource for studying the functionality of the human-associated microbiome and their relationship with human health and diseases. One application of these genomes is to provide a universal reference for database search in metaproteomic studies, when matched metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data are unavailable. However, a greater collection of reference genomes may not necessarily result in better peptide/protein identification because the increase of search space often leads to fewer spectrum-peptide matches, not to mention the drastic increase of computation time. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.] Methods: Here, we present a new approach that uses two steps to optimize the use of the reference genomes and MAGs as the universal reference for human gut metaproteomic MS/MS data analysis. The first step is to use only the high-abundance proteins (HAPs) (i.e., ribosomal proteins and elongation factors) for metaproteomic MS/MS database search and, based on the identification results, to derive the taxonomic composition of the underlying microbial community. The second step is to expand the search database by including all proteins from identified abundant species. We call our approach HAPiID (HAPs guided metaproteomics IDentification). Results: We tested our approach using human gut metaproteomic datasets from a previous study and compared it to the state-of-the-art reference database search method MetaPro-IQ for metaproteomic identification in studying human gut microbiota. Our results show that our two-steps method not only performed significantly faster but also was able to identify more peptides. We further demonstrated the application of HAPiID to revealing protein profiles of individual human-associated bacterial species, one or a few species at a time, using metaproteomic data. Conclusions: The HAP guided profiling approach presents a novel effective way for constructing target database for metaproteomic data analysis. The HAPiID pipeline built upon this approach provides a universal tool for analyzing human gut-associated metaproteomic data.	Stamboulian M.|Li S.|Ye Y.

Background: Plant defensins are a broadly distributed family of antimicrobial peptides which have been primarily studied for agriculturally relevant antifungal activity. Recent studies have probed defensins against Gram-negative bacteria revealing evidence for multiple mechanisms of action including membrane lysis and ribosomal inhibition. Herein, a truncated synthetic analog containing the γ-core motif of Amaranthus tricolor DEF2 (Atr-DEF2) reveals Gram-negative antibacterial activity and its mechanism of action is probed via proteomics, outer membrane permeability studies, and iron reduction/chelation assays. Results: Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) demonstrated activity against two Gram-negative human bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Quantitative proteomics revealed changes in the E. coli proteome in response to treatment of sub-lethal concentrations of the truncated defensin, including bacterial outer membrane (OM) and iron acquisition/processing related proteins. Modification of OM charge is a common response of Gram-negative bacteria to membrane lytic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to reduce electrostatic interactions, and this mechanism of action was confirmed for Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) via an N-phenylnaphthalen-1-amine uptake assay. Additionally, in vitro assays confirmed the capacity of Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) to reduce Fe3+ and chelate Fe2+ at cell culture relevant concentrations, thus limiting the availability of essential enzymatic cofactors. Conclusions: This study highlights the utility of plant defensin γ-core motif synthetic analogs for characterization of novel defensin activity. Proteomic changes in E. coli after treatment with Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) supported the hypothesis that membrane lysis is an important component of γ-core motif mediated antibacterial activity but also emphasized that other properties, such as metal sequestration, may contribute to a multifaceted mechanism of action.

Communities of bacteria called biofilms are characterized by reduced diffusion, steep oxygen, and redox gradients and specific properties compared to individualized planktonic bacteria. In this study, we investigated whether signaling via nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiols (S-nitrosylation), regulating a wide range of functions in eukaryotes, could also specifically occur in biofilms and contribute to bacterial adaptation to this widespread lifestyle. We used a redox proteomic approach to compare cysteine S-nitrosylation in aerobic and anaerobic biofilm and planktonic Escherichia coli cultures and we identified proteins with biofilm-specific S-nitrosylation status. Using bacterial genetics and various phenotypic screens, we showed that impairing S-nitrosylation in proteins involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid synthesis such as OxyR, KatG, and GltD altered important biofilm properties, including motility, biofilm maturation, or resistance to oxidative stress. Our study therefore revealed that S-nitrosylation constitutes a physiological basis underlying functions critical for E. coli adaptation to the biofilm environment.

Conventional approaches to identify secreted factors that regulate homeostasis are limited in their abilities to identify the tissues/cells of origin and destination. We established a platform to identify secreted protein trafficking between organs using an engineered biotin ligase (BirA*G3) that biotinylates, promiscuously, proteins in a subcellular compartment of one tissue. Subsequently, biotinylated proteins are affinity-enriched and identified from distal organs using quantitative mass spectrometry. Applying this approach in Drosophila, we identify 51 muscle-secreted proteins from heads and 269 fat body-secreted proteins from legs/muscles, including CG2145 (human ortholog ENDOU) that binds directly to muscles and promotes activity. In addition, in mice, we identify 291 serum proteins secreted from conditional BirA*G3 embryo stem cell-derived teratomas, including low-abundance proteins with hormonal properties. Our findings indicate that the communication network of secreted proteins is vast. This approach has broad potential across different model systems to identify cell-specific secretomes and mediators of interorgan communication in health or disease.

Crosslinking mass spectrometry has developed into a robust technique that is increasingly used to investigate the interactomes of organelles and cells. However, the incomplete and noisy information in the mass spectra of crosslinked peptides limits the numbers of protein–protein interactions that can be confidently identified. Here, we leverage chromatographic retention time information to aid the identification of crosslinked peptides from mass spectra. Our Siamese machine learning model xiRT achieves highly accurate retention time predictions of crosslinked peptides in a multi-dimensional separation of crosslinked E. coli lysate. Importantly, supplementing the search engine score with retention time features leads to a substantial increase in protein–protein interactions without affecting confidence. This approach is not limited to cell lysates and multi-dimensional separation but also improves considerably the analysis of crosslinked multiprotein complexes with a single chromatographic dimension. Retention times are a powerful complement to mass spectrometric information to increase the sensitivity of crosslinking mass spectrometry analyses.	Giese S.H.|Sinn L.R.|Wegner F.|Rappsilber J.

Synthetic metabolic pathways are a burden for engineered bacteria, but the underlying mechanisms often remain elusive. Here we show that the misregulated activity of the transcription factor Cra is responsible for the growth burden of glycerol overproducing E. coli. Glycerol production decreases the concentration of fructose-1,6-bisphoshate (FBP), which then activates Cra resulting in the downregulation of glycolytic enzymes and upregulation of gluconeogenesis enzymes. Because cells grow on glucose, the improper activation of gluconeogenesis and the concomitant inhibition of glycolysis likely impairs growth at higher induction of the glycerol pathway. We solve this misregulation by engineering a Cra-binding site in the promoter controlling the expression of the rate limiting enzyme of the glycerol pathway to maintain FBP levels sufficiently high. We show the broad applicability of this approach by engineering Cra-dependent regulation into a set of constitutive and inducible promoters, and use one of them to overproduce carotenoids in E. coli.

To construct a superior microbial cell factory for chemical synthesis, a major challenge is to fully exploit cellular potential by identifying and engineering beneficial gene targets in sophisticated metabolic networks. Here, we take advantage of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and omics analyses to systematically identify beneficial genes that can be engineered to promote free fatty acids (FFAs) production in Escherichia coli. CRISPRi-mediated genetic perturbation enables the identification of 30 beneficial genes from 108 targets related to FFA metabolism. Then, omics analyses of the FFAs-overproducing strains and a control strain enable the identification of another 26 beneficial genes that are seemingly irrelevant to FFA metabolism. Combinatorial perturbation of four beneficial genes involving cellular stress responses results in a recombinant strain ihfAL−-aidB+-ryfAM−-gadAH−, producing 30.0 g L−1 FFAs in fed-batch fermentation, the maximum titer in E. coli reported to date. Our findings are of help in rewiring cellular metabolism and interwoven intracellular processes to facilitate high-titer production of biochemicals.

Human PAK4 is an ubiquitously expressed p21-activated kinase which acts downstream of Cdc42. Since PAK4 is enriched in cell-cell junctions, we probed the local protein environment around the kinase with a view to understanding its location and substrates. We report that U2OS cells expressing PAK4-BirA-GFP identify a subset of 27 PAK4-proximal proteins that are primarily cell-cell junction components. Afadin/AF6 showed the highest relative biotin labelling and links to the nectin family of homophilic junctional proteins. Reciprocally >50% of the PAK4-proximal proteins were identified by Afadin BioID. Co-precipitation experiments failed to identify junctional proteins, emphasizing the advantage of the BioID method. Mechanistically PAK4 depended on Afadin for its junctional localization, which is similar to the situation in Drosophila. A highly ranked PAK4-proximal protein LZTS2 was immuno-localized with Afadin at cell-cell junctions. Though PAK4 and Cdc42 are junctional, BioID analysis did not yield conventional cadherins, indicating their spatial segregation. To identify cellular PAK4 substrates we then assessed rapid changes (12’) in phospho-proteome after treatment with two PAK inhibitors. Among the PAK4-proximal junctional proteins seventeen PAK4 sites were identified. We anticipate mammalian group II PAKs are selective for the Afadin/nectin sub-compartment, with a demonstrably distinct localization from tight and cadherin junctions.

It is generally recognized that proteins constitute the key cellular component in shaping microbial phenotypes. Due to limited cellular resources and space, optimal allocation of proteins is crucial for microbes to facilitate maximum proliferation rates while allowing a flexible response to environmental changes. To account for the growth condition-dependent proteome in the constraint-based metabolic modeling of Escherichia coli, we consolidated a coarse-grained protein allocation approach with the explicit consideration of enzymatic constraints on reaction fluxes. Besides representing physiologically relevant wild-type phenotypes and flux distributions, the resulting protein allocation model (PAM) advances the predictability of the metabolic responses to genetic perturbations. A main driver of mutant phenotypes was ascribed to inherited regulation patterns in protein distribution among metabolic enzymes. Moreover, the PAM correctly reflected metabolic responses to an augmented protein burden imposed by the heterologous expression of green fluorescent protein. In summary, we were able to model the effects of important and frequently applied metabolic engineering approaches on microbial metabolism. Therefore, we want to promote the integration of protein allocation constraints into classical constraint-based models to foster their predictive capabilities and application for strain analysis and engineering purposes. IMPORTANCE Predictive metabolic models are important, e.g., for generating biological knowledge and designing microbes with superior performance for target compound production. Yet today's whole-cell models either show insufficient predictive capabilities or are computationally too expensive to be applied to metabolic engineering purposes. By linking the inherent genotype-phenotype relationship to a complete representation of the proteome, the PAM advances the accuracy of simulated phenotypes and intracellular flux distributions of E. coli. Being equally computationally lightweight as classical stoichiometric models and allowing for the application of established in silico tools, the PAM and related simulation approaches will foster the use of a model-driven metabolic research. Applications range from the investigation of mechanisms of microbial evolution to the determination of optimal strain design strategies in metabolic engineering, thus supporting basic scientists and engineers alike.

Infections with many Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, rely on type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors. We hypothesized that while hijacking processes within mammalian cells, the effectors operate as a robust network that can tolerate substantial contractions. This was tested in vivo using the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (encoding 31 effectors). Sequential gene deletions showed that effector essentiality for infection was context dependent and that the network could tolerate 60% contraction while maintaining pathogenicity. Despite inducing very different colonic cytokine profiles (e.g., interleukin-22, interleukin-17, interferon-g, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), different networks induced protective immunity. Using data from >100 distinct mutant combinations, we built and trained a machine learning model able to predict colonization outcomes, which were confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, reproducing the human-restricted enteropathogenic E. coli effector repertoire in C. rodentium was not sufficient for efficient colonization, which implicates effector networks in host adaptation. These results unveil the extreme robustness of both T3SS effector networks and host responses.

The isocitrate lyases (ICL1/2) are essential enzymes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis. At present, no ICL1/2 inhibitors have progressed to clinical evaluation, despite extensive drug discovery efforts. Herein, we surveyed succinate analogs against ICL1 and found that dicarboxylic acids constrained in their synperiplanar conformations, such as maleic acid, comprise uncompetitive inhibitors of ICL1 and inhibit more potently than their trans-isomers. From this, we identified cis-2,3 epoxysuccinic acid (cis-EpS) as a selective, irreversible covalent inactivator of Mtb ICL1 (kinact/Kinact= (5.0 ± 1.4) × 104 M-1 s-1 Kinact = 200 ± 50 nM), the most potent inactivator of ICL1 yet characterized. Crystallographic and mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Cys191 of ICL1 was S-malylated by cis-EpS, and a crystallographic ""snapshot""of inactivation lent insight into the chemical mechanism of this inactivation. Proteomic analysis of E. coli lysates showed that cis-EpS selectively labeled plasmid-expressed Mtb ICL1. Consistently, cis-EpS, but not its trans-isomer, inhibited the growth of Mtb under conditions in which ICL function is essential. These findings encourage the development of analogs of cis-2,3-epoxysuccinate as antituberculosis agents.

GTPase high frequency of lysogenization X (HflX) is highly conserved in prokaryotes and acts as a ribosome-splitting factor as part of the heat shock response in Escherichia coli. Here we report that HflX produced by slow-growing Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is a GTPase that plays a critical role in the pathogen’s transition to a nonreplicating, drug-tolerant state in response to hypoxia. Indeed, HflX-deficient M. bovis BCG (KO) replicated markedly faster in the microaerophilic phase of a hypoxia model that resulted in premature entry into dormancy. The KO mutant displayed hallmarks of nonreplicating mycobacteria, including phenotypic drug resistance, altered morphology, low intracellular ATP levels, and overexpression of Dormancy (Dos) regulon proteins. Mice nasally infected with HflX KO mutant displayed increased bacterial burden in the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes during the chronic phase of infection, consistent with the higher replication rate observed in vitro in microaerophilic conditions. Unlike fast growing mycobacteria, M. bovis BCG HlfX was not involved in antibiotic resistance under aerobic growth. Proteomics, pull-down, and ribo-sequencing approaches supported that mycobacterial HflX is a ribosome-binding protein that controls translational activity of the cell. With HflX fully conserved between M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis, our work provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms deployed by pathogenic mycobacteria to adapt to their hypoxic microenvironment.

The “milky disease” of the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, is a highly lethal fungal disease caused by Metschnikowia bicuspidata infection. To elucidate the immune responses of the hemolymph of E. sinensis to M. bicuspidata infection, a comparative analysis of the hemolymph of E. sinensis infected with M. bicuspidata and that treated with phosphate buffered saline was performed using label-free quantitative proteomics. A total of 429 proteins were identified. Using a 1.5-fold change in expression as a physiologically significant benchmark, 62 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 38 were significantly upregulated and 24 were significantly downregulated. The upregulated proteins mainly included cytoskeleton-related proteins (myosin regulatory light chain 2, myosin light chain alkali, tubulin α-2 chain, and tubulin β-1 chain), serine protease and serine protease inhibitor (clip domain-containing serine protease, leukocyte elastase inhibitor, serine protein inhibitor 42Dd), catalase, transferrin, and heat shock protein 70. Upregulation of these proteins indicated that phenoloxidase system, phagocytosis and the ROS systems were induced by M. bicuspidata. The downregulated proteins were mainly organ and tissue regeneration proteins (PDGF/VEGF-related factor protein, integrin-linked protein kinase homing pat-4 gene) and hemagglutination-associated proteins (hemolymph clottable protein, hemocyte protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase). Downregulation of these proteins indicated that M. bicuspidata inhibited hemocyte regeneration and hemolymph agglutination. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins related to immunity were verified using a parallel reaction monitoring method. The expression trend of these proteins was similar to that of the proteome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the proteome of E. sinensis in response to M. bicuspidata infection. These results not only provide new and important information on the immune response of crustaceans to yeast infection but also provide a basis for further understanding the molecular mechanism of complex host pathogen interactions between crustaceans and fungi.

Meningitis is a potentially life-threatening infection characterized by the inflammation of the leptomeningeal membranes. Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae, and treatment options. Here, we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell-, and plasma proteins in the CSF, where, in particular, a large increase of neutrophil-derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multiprotein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell-and tissue-associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The same protein panel also enabled classification of tick-borne encephalitis, a subgroup of viral meningitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The work provides insights into pathogen-specific host response patterns in CSF from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen type based on host response patterns in meningitis.

Microorganisms adjust metabolic activity to cope with diverse environments. While many studies have provided insights into how individual pathways are regulated, the mechanisms that give rise to coordinated metabolic responses are poorly understood. Here, we identify the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate catabolism and anabolism in Escherichia coli. Integrating protein, metabolite, and flux changes in genetically implemented catabolic or anabolic limitations, we show that combined global and local mechanisms coordinate the response to metabolic limitations. To allocate proteomic resources between catabolism and anabolism, E. coli uses a simple global gene regulatory program. Surprisingly, this program is largely implemented by a single transcription factor, Crp, which directly activates the expression of catabolic enzymes and indirectly reduces the expression of anabolic enzymes by passively sequestering cellular resources needed for their synthesis. However, metabolic fluxes are not controlled by this regulatory program alone; instead, fluxes are adjusted mostly through passive changes in the local metabolite concentrations. These mechanisms constitute a simple but effective global regulatory program that coarsely partitions resources between different parts of metabolism while ensuring robust coordination of individual metabolic reactions.

Antibiotic resistance is growing as a public health concern worldwide. Understanding of antibiotic-resistant mechanisms is especially necessary for control of the antibiotic resistance. The present study determined a proteome of Escherichia coli in response to ampicillin. The proteome consisted of 16-differential abundance of proteins, belonging to 8 pathways and constructing a protein-protein network. iPath analysis showed the reduced central carbon metabolism, oxidative energy production pathways, and fatty acid biosynthesis as the responsible processes. These data are supported by the decreased enzyme activity of the pyruvate cycle, NADH, membrane potential, and ATP. Moreover, the present study identified AdhE and FabG as ampicillin-binding proteins from the 16-differential abundance of proteins. Further study was focused on the mechanism of adhE in the resistance. Ampicillin-stressed E. coli exhibited higher adhE expression with lower intracellular alcohol. However, loss of adhE lowered bacteria viability which was associated with high intracellular alcohol than ampicillin-stressed E. coli. Thus, AdhE plays a role in the resistance through regulation of intracellular alcohol. These findings are helpful in further understanding ampicillin resistance mechanisms.

We have developed a robust workflow to measure high-resolution fluxotypes (metabolic flux phenotypes) for large strain libraries under fully controlled growth conditions. This was achieved by optimizing and automating the whole high-throughput fluxomics process and integrating all relevant software tools. This workflow allowed us to obtain highly detailed maps of carbon fluxes in the central carbon metabolism in a fully automated manner. It was applied to investigate the glucose fluxotypes of 180 Escherichia coli strains deleted for y-genes. Since the products of these y-genes potentially play a role in a variety of metabolic processes, the experiments were designed to be agnostic as to their potential metabolic impact. The obtained data highlight the robustness of E. coli’s central metabolism to y-gene deletion. For two y-genes, deletion resulted in significant changes in carbon and energy fluxes, demonstrating the involvement of the corresponding y-gene products in metabolic function or regulation. This work also introduces novel metrics to measure the actual scope and quality of high-throughput fluxomics investigations.

Measuring host-bacteriophage dynamics is an important approach to understanding bacterial survival functions and responses to infection. The model Microviridae bacteriophage wX174 is endemic to the human gut and has been studied for over 70 years, but the host response to infection has never been investigated in detail. To address this gap in our understanding of this important interaction within our microbiome, we have measured host Escherichia coli C proteomic and transcriptomic response to wX174 infection. We used mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify and quantify all 11 wX174 proteins and over 1,700 E. coli proteins, enabling us to comprehensively map host pathways involved in wX174 infection. Most notably, we see significant host responses centered on membrane damage and remodeling, cellular chaperone and translocon activity, and lipoprotein processing, which we speculate is due to the peptidoglycan-disruptive effects of the wX174 lysis protein E on MraY activity. We also observe the massive upregulation of small heat shock proteins IbpA/B, along with other heat shock pathway chaperones, and speculate on how the specific characteristics of holdase protein activity may be beneficial for viral infections. Together, this study enables us to begin to understand the proteomic and transcriptomic host responses of E. coli to Microviridae infections and contributes insights to the activities of this important model host-phage interaction. IMPORTANCE A major part of the healthy human gut microbiome is the Microviridae bacteriophage, exemplified by the model wX174 phage, and their E. coli hosts. Although much has been learned from studying wX174 over the last half-century, until this work, the E. coli host response to infection has never been investigated in detail. We reveal the proteomic and transcriptomic pathways differentially regulated during the wX174 infection cycle and uncover the details of a coordinated cellular response to membrane damage that results in increased lipoprotein processing and membrane trafficking, likely due to the phage antibiotic-like lysis protein. We also reveal that small heat shock proteins IbpA/B are massively upregulated during infection and that these holdase chaperones are highly conserved across the domains of life, indicating that reliance on them is likely widespread across viruses.

Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex are increasingly implicated in difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections, as exemplified by a recently characterized highly carbapenem-resistant clinical Enterobacter roggenkampii isolate with sequence type (ST) 232. While mechanisms of carbapenem resistance are well-understood, little is known about the responses of highly drug-resistant bacteria to these antibiotics. Our present study was therefore aimed at charting the responses of the E. roggenkampii ST232 isolate to the carbapenem imipenem, using a ‘stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture’ approach for quantitative mass spectrometry. This unveiled diverse responses of E. roggenkampii ST232 to imipenem, especially altered levels of proteins for cell wall biogenesis, central carbon metabolism, respiration, iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, and metal homeostasis. These observations suggest a scenario where imipenem-challenged bacteria reduce metabolic activity to save resources otherwise used for cell wall biogenesis, and to limit formation of detrimental reactive oxygen species at the cytoplasmic membrane due to respiration and Fenton chemistry. We consider these observations important, because knowing the adaptive responses of a highly resistant bacterium of the E. cloacae complex to last-resort antibiotics, such as imipenem, provides a ‘sneak preview’ into the future development of antibiotic resistance in this emerging group of pathogens.

There are two main strategies for antibiotic discovery: target-based and phenotypic screen-ing. The latter has been much more successful in delivering first-in-class antibiotics, despite the major bottleneck of delayed Mechanism-of-Action (MOA) identification. Although finding new antimicrobial compounds is a very challenging task, identifying their MOA has proven equally challenging. MOA identification is important because it is a great facilitator of lead optimization and improves the chances of commercialization. Moreover, the ability to rapidly detect MOA could enable a shift from an activity-based discovery paradigm towards a mechanism-based approach. This would allow to probe the grey chemical matter, an underexplored source of structural novelty. In this study we review techniques with throughput suitable to screen large libraries and sufficient sensitivity to distinguish MOA. In particular, the techniques used in chemical genetics (e.g., based on overexpression and knockout/knockdown collections), promoter-reporter libraries, transcrip-tomics (e.g., using microarrays and RNA sequencing), proteomics (e.g., either gel-based or gel-free techniques), metabolomics (e.g., resourcing to nuclear magnetic resonance or mass spectrometry techniques), bacterial cytological profiling, and vibrational spectroscopy (e.g., Fourier-transform infrared or Raman scattering spectroscopy) were discussed. Ultimately, new and reinvigorated phenotypic assays bring renewed hope in the discovery of a new generation of antibiotics.	da Cunha B.R.|Zoio P.|Fonseca L.P.|Calado C.R.C.

Accurate measurements of cellular protein concentrations are invaluable to quantitative studies of gene expression and physiology in living cells. Here, we developed a versatile mass spectrometric workflow based on data-independent acquisition proteomics (DIA/SWATH) together with a novel protein inference algorithm (xTop). We used this workflow to accurately quantify absolute protein abundances in Escherichia coli for > 2,000 proteins over > 60 growth conditions, including nutrient limitations, non-metabolic stresses, and non-planktonic states. The resulting high-quality dataset of protein mass fractions allowed us to characterize proteome responses from a coarse (groups of related proteins) to a fine (individual) protein level. Hereby, a plethora of novel biological findings could be elucidated, including the generic upregulation of low-abundant proteins under various metabolic limitations, the non-specificity of catabolic enzymes upregulated under carbon limitation, the lack of large-scale proteome reallocation under stress compared to nutrient limitations, as well as surprising strain-dependent effects important for biofilm formation. These results present valuable resources for the systems biology community and can be used for future multi-omics studies of gene regulation and metabolic control in E. coli.

Trans-Cinnamaldehyde (TC) is a widely used food additive, known for its sterilization, disinfection, and antiseptic properties. However, its antibacterial mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, quantitative proteomics was performed to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in Escherichia coli in response to TC treatment. Bioinformatics analysis suggested aldehyde toxicity, acid stress, oxidative stress, interference of carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and protein translation as the bactericidal mechanism. E. coli BW25113δyqhD, δgldA, δbetB, δtktB, δgadA, δgadB, δgadC, and δrmf were used to investigate the functions of DEPs through biochemical methods. The present study revealed that TC exerts its antibacterial effects by inducing the toxicity of its aldehyde group producing acid stress. These findings will contribute to the application of TC in the antibacterial field.	Du G.F.|Yin X.F.|Yang D.H.|He Q.Y.|Sun X.

The large surfaces of gastrointestinal (GI) organs are well adapted to their diverse tasks of selective nutritional uptake and defense against the external environment. To maintain a functional balance, a vast number of immune cells is located within the mucosa. A strictly regulated immune response is required to impede constant inflammation and to maintain barrier function. An increasing prevalence of GI diseases has been reported in Western societies over the past decades. This surge in GI disorders has been linked to dietary changes followed by an imbalance of the gut microbiome, leading to a chronic, low grade inflammation of the gut epithelium. To counteract the increasing health care costs associated with diseases, it is paramount to understand the mechanisms driving immuno-nutrition, the associations between nutritional compounds, the commensal gut microbiota, and the host immune response. Dietary compounds such as lipids, play a central role in GI barrier function. Bioactive sphingolipids (SLs), e.g. sphingomyelin (SM), sphingosine (Sph), ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) may derive from dietary SLs ingested through the diet. They are not only integral components of cell membranes, they additionally modulate cell trafficking and are precursors for mediators and second messenger molecules. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, cell motility, cell proliferation and apoptosis, SL metabolites have been described to influence GI immune homeostasis positively and detrimentally. Furthermore, dietary SLs are suggested to induce a shift in the gut microbiota. Modes of action range from competing with the commensal bacteria for intestinal cell attachment to prevention from pathogen invasion by regulating innate and immediate defense mechanisms. SL metabolites can also be produced by gut microorganisms, directly impacting host metabolic pathways. This review aims to summarize recent findings on SL signaling and functional variations of dietary SLs. We highlight novel insights in SL homeostasis and SL impact on GI barrier function, which is directly linked to changes of the intestinal microbiota. Knowledge gaps in current literature will be discussed to address questions relevant for understanding the pivotal role of dietary SLs on chronic, low grade inflammation and to define a balanced and healthy diet for disease prevention and treatment.

Folate and related derivatives are essential small molecules required for survival. Of significant interest is the biological role and necessity of folate in the crosstalk between commensal organisms and their respective hosts, including the tremendously complex human distal gut microbiome. Here, we designed a folate-based probe consisting of a photo-crosslinker to detect and quantitate folate-binding proteins from proteomic samples. We demonstrate the selectivity of our probe for the well-established human folate-binding protein dihydrofolate reductase and show no promiscuous labeling occurs with human caspase-3 or bovine serum albumin, which served as negative controls. Affinity-based enrichment of folate-binding proteins from an E. coli lysate in combination with mass spectrometry proteomics verified the ability of our probe to isolate low-abundance folate-dependent proteins. We envision that our probe will serve as a tool to elucidate the roles of commensal microbial folate-binding proteins in health and microbiome-related diseases.

The function of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells highly depends on the mode of activation, either by recognition of bacterial metabolites via their T cell receptor (TCR) or in a TCR-independent manner via cytokines. The underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely understood. To define the activation of MAIT cells on the molecular level, we applied a multi-omics approach with untargeted transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Transcriptomic analysis of E. coli- and TCR-activated MAIT cells showed a distinct transcriptional reprogramming, including altered pathways, transcription factors and effector molecules. We validated the consequences of this reprogramming on the phenotype by proteomics and metabolomics. Thus, and to distinguish between TCR-dependent and -independent activation, MAIT cells were stimulated with IL12/IL18, anti-CD3/CD28 or both. Only a combination of both led to full activation of MAIT cells, comparable to activation by E. coli. Using an integrated network-based approach, we identified key drivers of the distinct modes of activation, including cytokines and transcription factors, as well as negative feedback regulators like TWIST1 or LAG3. Taken together, we present novel insights into the biological function of MAIT cells, which may represent a basis for therapeutic approaches to target MAIT cells in pathological conditions.

Genomic sequence analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii revealed the presence of a putative Acid Phosphatase (AcpA; EC 3.1.3.2). A plasmid construct was made, and recombinant protein (rAcpA) was expressed in E. coli. PAGE analysis (carried out under denaturing/ reducing conditions) of nickel-affinity purified protein revealed the presence of a nearhomogeneous band of approximately 37 kDa. The identity of the 37 kDa species was verified as rAcpA by proteomic analysis with a molecular mass of 34.6 kDa from the deduced sequence. The dependence of substrate hydrolysis on pH was broad with an optimum observed at 6.0. Kinetic analysis revealed relatively high affinity for PNPP (Km = 90 μM) with Vmax, kcat, and Kcat/Km values of 19.2 pmoles s-1, 4.80 s-1(calculated on the basis of 37 kDa), and 5.30 × 104 M-1s-1, respectively. Sensitivity to a variety of reagents, i.e., detergents, reducing, and chelating agents as well as classic acid phosphatase inhibitors was examined in addition to assessment of hydrolysis of a number of phosphorylated compounds. Removal of phosphate from different phosphorylated compounds is supportive of broad, i.e., 'nonspecific' substrate specificity; although, the enzyme appears to prefer phosphotyrosine and/or peptides containing phosphotyrosine in comparison to serine and threonine. Examination of the primary sequence indicated the absence of signature sequences characteristic of Type A, B, and C nonspecific bacterial acid phosphatases.

During infection, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) directly manipulate various aspects of host cell function through the translocation of type III secretion system (T3SS) effector proteins directly into the host cell. Many T3SS effector proteins are enzymes that mediate post-translational modifications of host proteins, such as the glycosyltransferase NleB1, which transfers a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to arginine residues, creating an Arg-GlcNAc linkage. NleB1 glycosylates death-domain containing proteins including FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 to block host cell death. The NleB1 paralogue, NleB2, is found in many EPEC and EHEC strains but to date its enzymatic activity has not been described. Using in vitro glycosylation assays combined with mass spectrometry, we found that NleB2 can utilize multiple sugar donors including UDP-glucose, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-galactose during glycosylation of the death domain protein, RIPK1. Sugar donor competition assays demonstrated that UDP-glucose was the preferred substrate of NleB2 and peptide sequencing identified the glycosylation site within RIPK1 as Arg603, indicating that NleB2 catalyses arginine glucosylation. We also confirmed that NleB2 catalysed arginine-hexose modification of Flag-RIPK1 during infection of HEK293T cells with EPEC E2348/69. Using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro glycosylation assays, we identified that residue Ser252 in NleB2 contributes to the specificity of this distinct catalytic activity. Substitution of Ser252 in NleB2 to Gly, or substitution of the corresponding Gly255 in NleB1 to Ser switches sugar donor preference between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-glucose. However, this switch did not affect the ability of the NleB variants to inhibit inflammatory or cell death signalling during HeLa cell transfection or EPEC infection.

Lysobacter are new biocontrol agents known for their prolific production of lytic enzymes and bioactive metabolites. L. enzymogenes is a predator of fungi and produces several structurally distinct antimicrobial compounds, such as the antifungal HSAF (heat stable antifungal factor) and analogs. The mechanism by which L. enzymogenes interacts with fungal prey is not well understood. Here, we found that the production of HSAF and analogs in L. enzymogenes OH11 was significantly induced in media supplemented with ground fungal mycelia or chitin. In the OH11 genome, we identified a gene (LeLPMO10A) that was annotated to encode a chitin-binding protein. The stimulation of HSAF and analogs by chitin was diminished when LeLPMO10A was deleted. We expressed the gene in E. coli and demonstrated that purified LeLPMO10A oxidatively cleaved chitin into oligomeric products, including 1,5 δ-lactones and aldonic acids. The results revealed that LeLPMO10A encodes a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, which has not been reported in Lysobacter. The metabolite analysis, antifungal assay, and proteomic analysis showed that the antifungal compounds and the chitin-cleaving LeLPMO10A are colocalized in outer membrane vesicles. The enzymatic products that resulted from in vitro LeLPMO10A-cleaved chitin also significantly induced HSAF and analogs in OH11. Scanning electron microscopic analysis indicated that spherical vesicles were formed outside of OH11 cells, and fewer OH11 cells were observed to attach to fungal hyphae when LeLPMO10A was deleted. Together, the study revealed a previously uncharacterized synergistic strategy utilized by the predatory Lysobacter during interaction with fungal prey.

Biofilms composed of multiple microorganisms colonize the surfaces of indwelling urethral catheters that are used serially by neurogenic bladder patients and cause chronic infections. Well-adapted pathogens in this niche are Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Enterococcus spp., species that cycle through adhesion and multilayered cell growth, trigger host immune responses, are starved off nutrients, and then disperse. Viable microbial foci retained in the urinary tract recolonize catheter surfaces. The molecular adaptations of bacteria in catheter biofilms (CBs) are not well-understood, promising new insights into this pathology based on host and microbial meta-omics analyses from clinical specimens. We examined catheters from nine neurogenic bladder patients longitudinally over up to 6 months. Taxonomic analyses from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)–based proteomics revealed that 95% of all catheter and corresponding urinary pellet (UP) samples contained bacteria. CB biomasses were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae spp. and often accompanied by lactic acid and anaerobic bacteria. Systemic antibiotic drug treatments of patients resulted in either transient or lasting microbial community perturbations. Neutrophil effector proteins were abundant not only in UP but also CB samples, indicating their penetration of biofilm surfaces. In the context of one patient who advanced to a kidney infection, Proteus mirabilis proteomic data suggested a combination of factors associated with this disease complication: CB biomasses were high; the bacteria produced urease alkalinizing the pH and triggering urinary salt deposition on luminal catheter surfaces; P. mirabilis utilized energy-producing respiratory systems more than in CBs from other patients. The NADH:quinone oxidoreductase II (Nqr), a Na+ translocating enzyme not operating as a proton pump, and the nitrate reductase A (Nar) equipped the pathogen with electron transport chains promoting growth under hypoxic conditions. Both P. mirabilis and E. coli featured repertoires of transition metal ion acquisition systems in response to human host-mediated iron and zinc sequestration. We discovered a new drug target, the Nqr respiratory system, whose deactivation may compromise P. mirabilis growth in a basic pH milieu. Animal models would not allow such molecular-level insights into polymicrobial biofilm metabolism and interactions because the complexity cannot be replicated.

This research aimed to define the inactivation and stress response of Escherichia coli MG1655-K12 and Listeria innocua ATCC 33091 cells after the treatment by liquid phase plasma discharges in bubbles. Variations of frequency (60, 90, and 120 Hz), gas (argon or air), and processing time (5 and 10 min) have been proposed to determine their influence after the plasma treatment on E. coli and L. innocua cells. The most effective inactivation was achieved at the 60 Hz, input gas argon, and 10 min of treatment time for the E. coli sample (7.3 log10 CFU/mL). Transmission electron microscopy figures illustrated death cells and cells with well-defined cell walls and membranes despite the conducted treatment. Proteomics analysis provided insights into the molecular response mechanisms underlying the plasma treatment regime. This study demonstrated that plasma treatment caused significant alterations in proteome and indicated the proteins that may play important roles in recovering treated cells. Identified proteins were classified into six functional groups: stress response, regulation of gene expression, translation, metabolism, sugar transport, and cell division.

BPI-inducible protein A (BipA), a highly conserved paralog of the well-known translational GTPases LepA and EF-G, has been implicated in bacterial motility, cold shock, stress response, biofilm formation, and virulence. BipA binds to the aminoacyl-(A) site of the bacterial ribosome and establishes contacts with the functionally important regions of both subunits, implying a specific role relevant to the ribosome, such as functioning in ribosome biogenesis and/or conditional protein translation. When cultured at suboptimal temperatures, the Escherichia coli bipA genomic deletion strain (ΔbipA) exhibits defects in growth, swimming motility, and ribosome assembly, which can be complemented by a plasmid-borne bipA supplementation or suppressed by the genomic rluC deletion. Based on the growth curve, soft agar swimming assay, and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, mutation of the catalytic residue His78 rendered plasmid-borne bipA unable to complement its deletion phenotypes. Interestingly, truncation of the C-terminal loop of BipA exacerbates the aforementioned phenotypes, demonstrating the involvement of BipA in ribosome assembly or its function. Furthermore, tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry analysis of the ΔbipA strain proteome revealed upregulations of a number of proteins (e.g., DeaD, RNase R, CspA, RpoS, and ObgE) implicated in ribosome biogenesis and RNA metabolism, and these proteins were restored to wild-type levels by plasmid-borne bipA supplementation or the genomic rluC deletion, implying BipA involvement in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. We have also determined that BipA interacts with ribosome 50S precursor (pre-50S), suggesting its role in 50S maturation and ribosome biogenesis. Taken together, BipA demonstrates the characteristics of a bona fide 50S assembly factor in ribosome biogenesis.	Goh K.J.|Ero R.|Yan X.F.|Park J.E.|Kundukad B.|Zheng J.|Sze S.K.|Gao Y.G.

Molecular chaperones assist with protein folding by interacting with nascent polypeptide chains (NCs) during translation. Whether the ribosome can sense chaperone defects and, in response, abort translation of misfolding NCs has not yet been explored. Here we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the ribosome-associated chaperone network in E. coli and the consequences of its dysfunction. Trigger factor and the DnaK (Hsp70) system are the major NC-binding chaperones. HtpG (Hsp90), GroEL, and ClpB contribute increasingly when DnaK is deficient. Surprisingly, misfolding because of defects in co-translational chaperone function or amino acid analog incorporation results in recruitment of the non-canonical release factor RF3. RF3 recognizes aberrant NCs and then moves to the peptidyltransferase site to cooperate with RF2 in mediating chain termination, facilitating clearance by degradation. This function of RF3 reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and is critical for proteostasis maintenance and cell survival under conditions of limited chaperone availability.

Human d-aspartate oxidase (hDASPO) is a FAD-dependent enzyme responsible for the degradation of d-aspartate (d-Asp). In the mammalian central nervous system, d-Asp behaves as a classical neurotransmitter, it is thought to be involved in neural development, brain morphology and behavior, and appears to be involved in several pathological states, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Apparently, the human DDO gene produces alternative transcripts encoding for three putative hDASPO isoforms, constituted by 341 (the ‘canonical’ form), 369, and 282 amino acids. Despite the increasing interest in hDASPO and its physiological role, little is known about these different isoforms. Here, the additional N-terminal peptide present in the hDASPO_369 isoform only has been identified in hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease female patients, while peptides corresponding to the remaining part of the protein were present in samples from male and female healthy controls and Alzheimer’s disease patients. The hDASPO_369 isoform was largely expressed in E. coli as insoluble protein, hampering with its biochemical characterization. Furthermore, we generated U87 human glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing hDASPO_341 and, for the first time, hDASPO_369 isoforms; the latter protein showed a lower expression compared with the canonical isoform. Both protein isoforms are active (showing similar kinetic properties), localize to the peroxisomes, are very stable (a half-life of approximately 100 h has been estimated), and are primarily degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome system. These studies shed light on the properties of hDASPO isoforms with the final aim to clarify the mechanisms controlling brain levels of the neuromodulator d-Asp.

Gram-negative bacteria export a large variety of antimicrobial compounds by forming two-membrane spanning tripartite multidrug efflux systems composed of an inner membrane transporter, an outer membrane channel and a periplasmic adaptor protein. Here we present the co-expression, purification and first electron microscopy insights of the Escherichia coli EmrAB–TolC tripartite Major Facilitator Superfamily (MSF) efflux system as a whole complex stabilized by Amphipol polymer. The structure reveals a 33 nm long complex delineated by the Amphipol belt at both extremities. Comparison of projection structures of EmrAB-TolC and AcrAB-TolC indicates that the outer membrane protein TolC linked to the periplasmic adaptor EmrA protein form an extended periplasmic canal. The overall length of EmrAB-TolC complex is similar to that of AcrAB-TolC with a probable tip-to-tip interaction between EmrA and TolC unveiling how the adaptor protein connects TolC and EmrB embedded in the inner membrane.

Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. causing illnesses in humans represent a genotypically and phenotypically diverse group of pathogens. Although E. coli diversity has been studied by comparative genomics, the intra-species variation at the proteome level is currently unknown. The proteomes of 16 pathogenic E. coli, 2 non-pathogenic E. coli, and 5 Shigella strains originating from 18 phylogenetic lineages are investigated. By applying label-free quantitative proteomics on trypsin-digested cell extracts from bacteria grown on blood agar, 4018 proteins are detected, 3285 of which arequantified, and 261 represented virulence factors. Of 753 proteins quantified in all strains, the levels of 153 vary substantially between strains and are functionally associated mostly with stress response and peripheral metabolism. The levels of proteins associated with the central metabolism vary considerably less than the levels of proteins from other metabolic pathways. Hierarchical clustering analysis based on the protein levels results in strains grouping that differ from that obtained by gene-based phylogenetic analysis. Finally, strains of some E. coli pathotypes have more similar protein profiles even when the strains are not genetically closely related. The results suggest that the degree of genetic relatedness may not necessarily be a good predictor of E. coli phenotypic characteristics.	Pettersen V.K.|Steinsland H.|Wiker H.G.

Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors that maintain cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in diverse tissue microenvironments. They mediate cell adhesion and signaling through the assembly of large cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes that focally connect with the cytoskeleton. Integrin adhesion complexes (IAC) are specialized by the type of integrin-ECM contact and are sensitive to mechanical forces. Thus, they encrypt context-dependent information about the microenvironment in their composition. Signals mediated through IACs modulate many aspects of cell behavior, which allows cells to adapt to their surroundings. To gain insights into their function, IACs have been isolated from cultured cells and explored by proteomics. IACs are insoluble by nature and held together by transient/weak interactions, which makes it challenging to isolate intact IACs. Usually all IACs coupled to a specified ECM, which may employ different integrins, are isolated. Here we describe an alternative method based on proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), where specific integrin interaction partners are labeled in live cells and isolated without the need to isolate intact IACs.

Extibacter muris is a newly described mouse gut bacterium which metabolizes cholic acid (CA) to deoxycholic acid (DCA) via 7α-dehydroxylation. Although bile acids influence metabolic and inflammatory responses, few in vivo models exist for studying their metabolism and impact on the host. Mice were colonized from birth with the simplified community Oligo-MM12 with or without E. muris. As the metabolism of bile acids is known to affect lipid homeostasis, mice were fed either a low- or high-fat diet for eight weeks before sampling and analyses targeting the gut and liver. Multiple Oligo-MM12 strains were capable of deconjugating primary bile acids in vitro. E. muris produced DCA from CA either as pure compound or in mouse bile. This production was inducible by CA in vitro. Ursodeoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, and β-muricholic acid were not metabolized under the conditions tested. All gnotobiotic mice were stably colonized with E. muris, which showed higher relative abundances after HF diet feeding. The presence of E. muris had minor, diet-dependent effects on Oligo-MM12 communities. The secondary bile acids DCA and surprisingly LCA and their taurine conjugates were detected exclusively in E. muris-colonized mice. E. muris colonization did not influence body weight, white adipose tissue mass, liver histopathology, hepatic aspartate aminotransferase, or blood levels of cholesterol, insulin, and paralytic peptide (PP). However, proteomics revealed shifts in hepatic pathways involved in amino acid, glucose, lipid, energy, and drug metabolism in E. muris-colonized mice. Liver fatty acid composition was substantially altered by dietary fat but not by E. muris.In summary, E. muris stably colonized the gut of mice harboring a simplified community and produced secondary bile acids, which affected proteomes in the liver. This new gnotobiotic mouse model can now be used to study the pathophysiological role of secondary bile acids in vivo.

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is conserved in all living organ-isms, and it cotranslationally delivers proteins to the inner membrane or endoplas-mic reticulum. Recently, SRP loss was found not to be lethal in either the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the prokaryote Streptococcus mutans. In Escherichia coli, the role of SRP in mediating inner membrane protein (IMP) targeting has long been studied. However, the essentiality of SRP remains a controversial topic, partly hindered by the lack of strains in which SRP is completely absent. Here we show that the SRP was nonessential in E. coli by suppressor screening. We identified two classes of extragenic suppressors—two translation initiation factors and a ribo-somal protein—all of which are involved in translation initiation. The translation rate and inner membrane proteomic analyses were combined to define the mechanism that compensates for the lack of SRP. The primary factor that contributes to the efficiency of IMP targeting is the extension of the time window for targeting by pausing the initiation of translation, which further reduces translation initiation and elongation rates. Furthermore, we found that easily predictable features in the nascent chain determine the specificity of protein targeting. Our results show why the loss of the SRP pathway does not lead to lethality. We report a new paradigm in which the time delay in translation initiation is beneficial during protein targeting in the absence of SRP. IMPORTANCE Inner membrane proteins (IMPs) are cotranslationally inserted into the inner membrane or endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle (SRP). Generally, the deletion of SRP can result in protein targeting defects in Escherichia coli. Suppressor screening for loss of SRP reveals that pausing at the translation start site is likely to be critical in allowing IMP targeting and avoiding aggregation. In this work, we found for the first time that SRP is nonessential in E. coli. The time delay in initiation is different from the previous mechanism that only slows down the elongation rate. It not only maximizes the opportunity for untranslated ribosomes to be near the inner membrane but also extends the time window for targeting translating ribosomes by decreasing the speed of translation. We anticipate that our work will be a starting point for a more delicate regulatory mechanism of protein targeting.	Zhao L.|Cui Y.|Fu G.|Xu Z.|Liao X.|Zhang D.

Biotinylation identification (BioID) is a method designed to provide new cellular location and functional knowledge of the protein of interest through the identification of those proteins surrounding and in direct contact. A biotin ligase is fused onto the protein of interest and expressed in cells where it can biotinylate even short-lived transient protein complexes. In addition, due to the proximity labeling nature of the experiment, cellular localization and functional enrichment information can also be obtained. Since labeling occurs only after the addition of biotin, temporal relationships and localization changes (e.g., cytoplasmic to nuclear) can also be identified. Labeled proteins are easily purified, and contaminants minimized, using the strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified proteins allows for the identification of potential interactors for further validation and characterization.	Habel J.E.

The interaction disorder between gut microbiota and its host has been documented in different non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disease, and autoimmune disease. The majority of these altered interactions arise through metabolic cross-talk between gut microbiota and host immune system, inducing a low-grade chronic inflammation that characterizes all NCDs. In this review, we discuss the contribution of bacterial metabolites to immune signaling pathways involved in NCDs. We then review recent advances that aid to rationally design microbial therapeutics. A deeper understanding of these intersections between host and gut microbiota metabolism using metabolomics-based system biology platform promises to reveal the fundamental mechanisms that drive metabolic predispositions to disease and suggest new avenues to use microbial therapeutic opportunities for NCDs treatment and prevention.

Objectives: In the present study, proteomics was utilized to evaluate changes in Escherichia coli proteins in response to ofloxacin to understand the mechanism of action of ofloxacin and the mechanisms of ofloxacin resistance in E. coli. Materials and Methods: Proteomics analysis of E. coli was performed by using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry followed by a data processing step using MaxQuant. Functional classification and pathway analysis showed a systematic effect of ofloxacin over E. coli proteome structure. Results: In total, 649 common proteins were identified in the untreated and ofloxacin-treated groups, while 98 proteins were significantly different in the ofloxacin-treated group. Functional classification and pathway analysis showed that ofloxacin has a systematic effect over ribosomal processes, energy pathways (tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis), membrane proteins, microbial targets, and biofilm formation. Conclusion: The results showed that ofloxacin affected many cellular processes and pathways. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed that E. coli develops resistance mechanism with different biological processes.	Koçak E.|Özkul C.

However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RsePdeficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.

Mining of metabolite-protein interaction networks facilitates the identification of design principles underlying the regulation of different cellular processes. However, identification and characterization of the regulatory role that metabolites play in interactions with proteins on a genome-scale level remains a pressing task. Based on availability of high-quality metabolite-protein interaction networks and genome-scale metabolic networks, here we propose a supervised machine learning approach, called CIRI that determines whether or not a metabolite is involved in a competitive inhibitory regulatory interaction with an enzyme. First, we show that CIRI outperforms the naive approach based on a structural similarity threshold for a putative competitive inhibitor and the substrates of a metabolic reaction. We also validate the performance of CIRI on several unseen data sets and databases of metabolite-protein interactions not used in the training, and demonstrate that the classifier can be effectively used to predict competitive inhibitory interactions. Finally, we show that CIRI can be employed to refine predictions about metabolite-protein interactions from a recently proposed PROMIS approach that employs metabolomics and proteomics profiles from size exclusion chromatography in E. coli to predict metabolite-protein interactions. Altogether, CIRI fills a gap in cataloguing metabolite-protein interactions and can be used in directing future machine learning efforts to categorize the regulatory type of these interactions.

Rho is a hexameric bacterial RNA helicase, which became a paradigm of factor-dependent transcription termination. The broadly accepted (“textbook”) model posits a series of steps, wherein Rho first binds C-rich Rho utilization (rut) sites on nascent RNA, uses its ATP-dependent translocase activity to catch up with RNA polymerase (RNAP), and either pulls the transcript from the elongation complex or pushes RNAP forward, thus terminating transcription. However, this appealingly simple mechano-chemical model lacks a biological realism and is increasingly at odds with genetic and biochemical data. Here, we summarize recent structural and biochemical studies that have advanced our understanding of molecular details of RNA recognition, termination signaling, and RNAP inactivation in Rho-dependent transcription termination, rebalancing the view in favor of an alternative “allosteric” mechanism. In the revised model, Rho binds RNAP early in elongation assisted by the cofactors NusA and NusG, forming a pre-termination complex (PTC). The formation of PTC allows Rho to continuously sample nascent transcripts for a termination signal, which subsequently traps the elongation complex in an inactive state prior to its dissociation.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) is an indispensable metabolic co-substrate and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is an important Ca2+ releasing intracellular second messenger. Exploration of the NADP and NAADP interactome often requires the synthesis of NADP derivatives substituted on the adenosine nucleoside. The introduction of the 2′-phosphate of NADP makes the synthesis of substituted NADP derivatives difficult. We have employed recombinant human NAD kinase expressed in E. coli as an enzymatic reagent to convert readily available synthetic NAD derivatives to NADP analogs, which were subsequently transformed into NAADP derivatives using enzyme catalyzed pyridine base exchange. 8-Ethynyl-NADP, 8-ethynyl-NAADP and 5-N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP were synthesized starting from a protected 8-ethynyladenosine using a combination of chemical and enzymatic steps and the NAADP derivatives shown to be recognized by the sea urchin NAADP receptor at low concentration. Our methodology will enable researchers to produce mono- and bi-substituted NADP and NAADP analogs that can be applied in proteomic studies to identify NADP and NAADP binding proteins.

The ability of metal ionophores to induce cellular metal hyperaccumulation endows them with potent antimicrobial activity; however, the targets and mechanisms behind these outcomes are not well understood. This work describes the first utilization of proteome-wide measurements of protein folding stability in combination with protein expression level analysis to identify protein targets of copper, thereby providing new insight into ionophore-induced copper toxicity in E. coli. The protein folding stability analysis employed a one-pot protocol for pulse proteolysis (PP) in combination with a semi-tryptic peptide enrichment strategy for proteolysis procedures (STEPP) to generate stability profiles for proteins in cell lysates derived from E. coli exposed to copper with and without two ionophores, the antimicrobial agent pyrithione and its β-lactamase-activated prodrug, PcephPT. As part of this work, the above cell lysates were also subject to protein expression level analysis using conventional quantitative bottom-up proteomic methods. The protein folding stability and expression level profiles generated here enabled the effects of ionophore vs copper to be distinguished and revealed copper-driven stability changes in proteins involved in processes spanning metabolism, translation, and cell redox homeostasis. The 159 differentially stabilized proteins identified in this analysis were significantly more numerous (∼3×) than the 53 proteins identified with differential expression levels. These results illustrate the unique information that protein stability measurements can provide to decipher metal-dependent processes in drug mode of action studies.

The selection of growth media is a very important consideration of any cell-based proteomics experiment. Alterations thereof may result in differences in basal proteomes simply due to disparities in the metabolite composition of the media. We investigate the effect of growth media on the proteomes of three microorganisms, specifically E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe, using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. We compared the protein abundance profiles of these microorganisms propagated in two distinct growth media that are commonly used for the respective organism. Our sample preparation strategy included SP3 bead-assisted protein isolation and digestion. In addition, we assembled a replicate set of samples in which we altered the proteolytic digestion from sequential treatment with LysC and trypsin to only LysC. Despite differences in peptides identified and a drop in quantified proteins, the results were similar between the two datasets for all three microorganisms. Approximately 10% of the proteins of each respective microorganism were significantly altered in each dataset. As expected, gene ontology analysis revealed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins are implicated in metabolism. These data emphasize further the importance and the potential consequences of growth media selection. Significance: Various microorganisms are used as model systems throughout in biological studies, including proteomics-based investigations. The growth conditions of these organisms are of utmost importance, of which one major consideration is the choice of growth media. We hypothesize that growth media selection has a considerable impact on the baseline proteome of a given microorganism. To test this hypothesis, we used tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative multiplexed proteomics to profile the proteomes of E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe each grown in two different, yet common, growth media for the respective species. Our data show that approximately 10% of the proteins of each respective microorganism were significantly altered and that many of the differentially expressed proteins are implicated in metabolism. We provide several datasets which are potentially valuable for growth media selection with respect to downstream biochemical analysis.	Navarrete-Perea J.|Gygi S.P.|Paulo J.A.

Biological processes are regulated by intermolecular interactions and chemical modifications that do not affect protein levels, thus escaping detection in classical proteomic screens. We demonstrate here that a global protein structural readout based on limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) detects many such functional alterations, simultaneously and in situ, in bacteria undergoing nutrient adaptation and in yeast responding to acute stress. The structural readout, visualized as structural barcodes, captured enzyme activity changes, phosphorylation, protein aggregation, and complex formation, with the resolution of individual regulated functional sites such as binding and active sites. Comparison with prior knowledge, including other ‘omics data, showed that LiP-MS detects many known functional alterations within well-studied pathways. It suggested distinct metabolite-protein interactions and enabled identification of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-based regulatory mechanism of glucose uptake in E. coli. The structural readout dramatically increases classical proteomics coverage, generates mechanistic hypotheses, and paves the way for in situ structural systems biology.

Isoprenoids are vital for all organisms, in which they maintain membrane stability and support core functions such as respiration1. IspH, an enzyme in the methyl erythritol phosphate pathway of isoprenoid synthesis, is essential for Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria and apicomplexans2,3. Its substrate, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), is not produced in metazoans, and in humans and other primates it activates cytotoxic Vγ9Vδ2 T cells at extremely low concentrations4–6. Here we describe a class of IspH inhibitors and refine their potency to nanomolar levels through structure-guided analogue design. After modification of these compounds into prodrugs for delivery into bacteria, we show that they kill clinical isolates of several multidrug-resistant bacteria—including those from the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Vibrio, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Mycobacterium and Bacillus—yet are relatively non-toxic to mammalian cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that bacteria treated with these prodrugs resemble those after conditional IspH knockdown. Notably, these prodrugs also induce the expansion and activation of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in a humanized mouse model of bacterial infection. The prodrugs we describe here synergize the direct killing of bacteria with a simultaneous rapid immune response by cytotoxic γδ T cells, which may limit the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacterial populations.

Plantaricin BM-1, a class IIa bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum BM-1, has significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed to explore the role of the Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane (OM) channel protein TolC in the response to plantaricin BM-1. The tolC null mutant (E. coli K12∆tolC) was constructed by Red homologous recombination. The mechanism of tolC regulating the sensitivity of E. coli K12 under plantaricin BM-1 was investigated. tolC null mutation significantly increased the E. coli K12 sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1 and inhibited biofilm formation, and cells ruptured and shrunk. Proteomic analysis showed that the AcrAB-TolC and EmrAB-TolC efflux pumps were significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in E. coli K12∆tolC. Based on the results of real-time PCR, we concluded that under plantaricin BM-1, the CpxR/CpxA two-component regulatory system of E. coli K12 responded with envelope damage, followed by activation of the transcription of marA and expression of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Moreover, tolC null mutation weakened the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump and then increased the sensitivity of E. coli K12 to plantaricin BM-1. These will contribute exploring the action mechanism of class IIa bacteriocins against Gram-negative bacteria.	Wang H.|Zhang H.|Zhang H.|Jin J.|Xie Y.

Antimony, like arsenic, is a toxic metalloid widely distributed in the environment. Microbial detoxification of antimony has recently been identified. Here we describe a novel bacterial P1B-type antimonite (Sb(III))-translocating ATPase from the antimony-mining bacterium Comamonas testosterone JL40 that confers resistance to Sb(III). In a comparative proteomics analysis of strain JL40, an operon (ant operon) was up-regulated by Sb(III). The ant operon includes three genes, antR, antC and antA. AntR belongs to the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins that regulates expression of the ant operon. AntA belongs to the P1B family of the P-type cation-translocating ATPases. It has both similarities to and differences from other members of the P1B-1 subfamily and appears to be the first identified member of a distinct subfamily that we designate P1B-8. Expression AntA in E. coli AW3110 (Δars) conferred resistance to Sb(III) and reduced the intracellular concentration of Sb(III) but not As(III) or other metals. Everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing antA accumulated Sb(III) but not As(III), where uptake in everted vesicles reflects efflux from cells. AntC is a small protein with a potential Sb(III) binding site, and co-expression of AntC with AntA increased resistance to Sb(III). We propose that AntC functions as an Sb(III) chaperone to AntA, augmenting Sb(III) efflux. The identification of a novel Sb(III)-translocating ATPase enhances our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of environmental antimony by bacteria.

Mono(ADP‐ribosyl)ation (MARylation) is a regulatory post‐translational modification of proteins that controls their functions through a variety of mechanisms. MARylation is catalyzed by mono(ADP‐ribosyl) transferase (MART) enzymes, a subclass of the poly(ADP‐ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes. Although the role of PARPs and poly(ADP‐ribosyl)ation (PARylation) in cellular pathways, such as DNA repair and transcription, is well studied, the role of MARylation and MARTs (i.e., the PARP ‘monoenzymes’) are not well understood. Moreover, compared to PARPs, the development of MART‐targeted therapeutics is in its infancy. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on the structural features, catalytic targets, and biological functions of MARTs. The development of new technologies to study MARTs have uncovered essential roles for these enzymes in the regulation of cellular processes, such as RNA metabolism, cellular transport, focal adhesion, and stress responses. These insights have increased our understanding of the biological functions of MARTs in cancers, neuronal development, and immune responses. Furthermore, several novel inhibitors of MARTs have been developed and are nearing clinical utility. In this review, we summarize the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of MARTs and MARylation, as well as recent advances in technology that have enabled detection and inhibition of their activity. We emphasize PARP‐7, which is at the forefront of the MART subfamily with respect to understanding its biological roles and the development of therapeutically useful inhibitors. Collectively, the available studies reveal a growing understanding of the biochemistry, chemical biology, physiology, and pathology of MARTs.	Challa S.|Stokes M.S.|Kraus W.L.

Recent studies have shown that a key strategy of many pathogens is to use post-translational modification (PTMs) to modulate host factors critical for infection. Lysine succinylation (Ksuc) is a major PTM widespread in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and is associated with the regulation of numerous important cellular processes. Vibrio alginolyticus is a common pathogen that causes serious disease problems in aquaculture. Here we used the affinity enrichment method with LC-MS/MS to report the first identification of 2082 lysine succinylation sites on 671 proteins in V. alginolyticus, and compared this with the lysine acetylation of V. alginolyticus in our previous work. The Ksuc modification of SodB and PEPCK proteins were further validated by Co-immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the identified lysine succinylated proteins are involved in various biological processes and central metabolism pathways. Moreover, a total of 1,005 (25.4%) succinyl sites on 502 (37.3%) proteins were also found to be acetylated, which indicated that an extensive crosstalk between acetylation and succinylation in V. alginolyticus occurs, especially in three central metabolic pathways: glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, and pyruvate metabolism. Furthermore, we found at least 50 (7.45%) succinylated virulence factors, including LuxS, Tdh, SodB, PEPCK, ClpP, and the Sec system to play an important role in bacterial virulence. Taken together, this systematic analysis provides a basis for further study on the pathophysiological role of lysine succinylation in V. alginolyticus and provides targets for the development of attenuated vaccines.

Butanol can be produced biologically through fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass-derived sugars by Gram-positive Clostridium species. For cost-effective production, increased butanol fermentation titers are desired. However, the currently available butanol-fermenting microbes do not tolerate sufficiently high butanol concentrations; thus, new butanol-tolerant strains are desired. One promising strategy is to genetically modify Clostridium species by introducing stress tolerance-associated genes. This study was aimed to seek butanol tolerance genes from other Gram-positive species, which might be better suited than those from Gram-negative E. coli or eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several butanol-tolerant lactobacilli were reported previously, and Lactobacillus mucosae BR0713-33, which showed the most robust anaerobic growth in 4% butanol, was used here for proteomics analyses. Cellular proteins that responded to 2, 3, and 4% butanol were characterized. Twenty-nine proteins that were identified were dysregulated in response to increased concentrations of butanol in L. mucosae. Seventeen genes involved in coding for stress-tolerant proteins GroES, GroEL, and DnaK and genes involved in substrate utilization, fatty acid metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis were induced by increased butanol, and 12 genes involving energy production (F0F1ATP synthases) and redox balance preservation were repressed by increased butanol. These results can help guide targeted engineering strategies to improve tolerance and production of biobutanol.	Liu S.|Qureshi N.|Bischoff K.|Darie C.C.

Abstract: Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhP), catalase G (KatG), and catalase E (KatE) are the main enzymes to scavenge the excessive hydrogen peroxide in E. coli. It was found the concentration of endogenous H2O2 was submicromolar in a mutant strain E. coli MG1655/ΔAhpΔKatEΔKatG, which was enough to cause damage to DNA and proteins as well as concomitant cell growth and metabolism. However, few studies explored how submicromolar intracellular hydrogen peroxide alters protein function and regulates the signaling pathways at the proteome level. In order to study the effect of endogenous oxidative stress caused by submicromolar hydrogen peroxide, this study first constructed a mutant strain E. coli MG1655/ΔAhpΔKatEΔKatG. Then, label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was used to quantify the differentially expressed proteins between the wild-type strain and the mutant strain. A total of 265 proteins were observed as differentially expressed proteins including 108 upregulated proteins and 157 downregulated proteins. Among them, three differentially expressed proteins were also validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) methodology. The 265 differentially expressed proteins are not only involved with many metabolism pathways including the TCA cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the glyoxylic acid cycle, but also activated the DNA repair and cellular antioxidant signaling pathway. These findings not only demonstrated that ahp, katE, and katG played the critical role in aerobic growth but also delineated proteins network and pathway regulated by submicromolar intracellular hydrogen peroxide, which allowed a deeper understanding of oxidative signaling in E. coli. The findings of this study also demonstrate that the mutant E. coli may serve as a cell model to investigate the effect of endogenous oxidative stress and downstream signaling pathways. Key points: • The mutant strain E. coli MG1655/ΔAhpΔKatEΔKatG was constructed to study the effect of endogenous oxidative stress in E. coli. • A total of 265 differentially expressed proteins were quantified and enriched in metabolic pathways and antioxidant systems by using label-free proteomics analysis. • The findings of this study demonstrate that the mutant E. coli may serve as an effective tool to investigate the endogenous oxidative stress.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation, swelling, and joint destruction primarily affecting the peripheral joints. In recent years, RA has become an alarming concern affecting more than 1.5% of the population worldwide. The majority of the drugs in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis are immunomodulatory. The development of novel drugs for RA is impending and scientists are exploring new strategies through various innovative approaches for RA drug development. Treat-to-target and window of opportunity hypothesis are the new approaches that are used to treat, improve outcomes, and prevent long-term use of ineffective therapy, respectively. Novel therapeutic agents (e.g. GM-CSF inhibitors, Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors) and delivery systems (e.g., Liposomes, Superparamagnetic iron oxide nano particles (SPIONs)) are under investigation for more target based therapy with reduced side effects and toxicity. The new drug discovery and repositioning of previously FDA-approved drugs are also being considered for chronic inflammatory disorder. The review encompasses a vast array of information, including genetics, etiology, clinical symptoms, current treatment, and newer therapeutics approaches, focused on the development of RA interventions. The introduction of the bioinformatics-based approach in RA has also been significantly discussed in the review. This review provides a general understanding of the challenges and uncertainties in the treatment of RA and summarizes the evolving scenario as well as innovative approaches taken into consideration for drug development in rheumatoid arthritis.

Iron is a vital nutrient to bacteria, not only in the basal metabolism but also for virulent species in infection and pathogenicity at their hosts. Despite its relevance, the role of iron in Xanthomonas citri infection, the etiological agent of citrus canker disease, is poorly understood in contrast to other pathogens, including other members of the Xanthomonas genus. In this review, we present iron assimilation pathways in X. citri including the ones for siderophore production and siderophore-iron assimilation, proven to be key factors to virulence in many organisms like Escherichia coli and Xanthomonas campestris. Based on classical iron-related proteins previously characterized in E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and also Xanthomonadaceae, we identified orthologs in X. citri and evaluated their sequences, structural characteristics such as functional motifs, and residues that support their putative functions. Among the identified proteins are TonB-dependent receptors, periplasmic-binding proteins, active transporters, efflux pumps, and cytoplasmic enzymes. The role of each protein for the bacterium was analyzed and complemented with proteomics data previously reported. The global view of different aspects of iron regulation and nutrition in X. citri virulence and pathogenesis may help guide future investigations aiming the development of new drug targets against this important phytopathogen.

Microbial reduction of selenite [Se(IV)] and tellurite [Te(IV)] to Se(0) and Te(0) can function as a detoxification mechanism and serve in energy conservation. In this study, Bacillus sp. Y3 was isolated and demonstrated to have an ability of simultaneous reduction of Se(IV) and Te(IV) during aerobic cultivation, with reduction efficiencies of 100% and 90%, respectively. Proteomics analysis revealed that the putative thioredoxin disulfide reductase (TrxR) and sulfate and energy metabolic pathway proteins were significantly upregulated after the addition of Se(IV) and Te(IV). qRT-PCR also showed an increased trxR transcription level in the presence of Se(IV) and Te(IV). Compared with a wild-type Escherichia coli strain, the TrxR-overexpressed E. coli strain showed higher Se(IV) and Te(IV) resistance levels and reduction efficiencies. Additionally, the TrxR showed in vitro Se(IV) and Te(IV) reduction activities when NADPH or NADH were present. When NADPH was used as the electron donor, the optimum conditions for enzyme activities were pH 8.0 and 37°C. The Km values of Te(IV) and Se(IV) were 16.31 and 2.91 mM, and the Vmax values of Te(IV) and Se(IV) were 12.23 and 11.20 μMmin-1mg-1, respectively. The discovery of the new reductive enzyme TrxR enriches the repertoire of the bacterial Se(IV) and Te(IV) resistance and reduction mechanisms. Bacillus sp. Y3 can efficiently reduce Se(IV) and Te(IV) simultaneously. Strain Y3 provides potential applications for selenite and tellurite bioremediation. The TrxR enzyme shows high catalytic activity for reducing Se(IV) and Te(IV). The discovery of TrxR enriches the bacterial Se(IV) and Te(IV) reduction mechanisms.

Ion mobility brings an additional dimension of separation to LC–MS, improving identification of peptides and proteins in complex mixtures. A recently introduced timsTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) couples trapped ion mobility separation to TOF mass analysis. With the parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) method, the timsTOF platform achieves promising results, yet analysis of the data generated on this platform represents a major bottleneck. Currently, MaxQuant and PEAKS are most used to analyze these data. However, because of the high complexity of timsTOF PASEF data, both require substantial time to perform even standard tryptic searches. Advanced searches (e.g. with many variable modifications, semi- or non-enzymatic searches, or open searches for post-translational modification discovery) are practically impossible. We have extended our fast peptide identification tool MSFragger to support timsTOF PASEF data, and developed a label-free quantification tool, IonQuant, for fast and accurate 4-D feature extraction and quantification. Using a HeLa data set published by Meier et al. (2018), we demonstrate that MSFragger identifies significantly (~30%) more unique peptides than MaxQuant (1.6.10.43), and performs comparably or better than PEAKS X1 (~10% more peptides). IonQuant outperforms both in terms of number of quantified proteins while maintaining good quantification precision and accuracy. Runtime tests show that MSFragger and IonQuant can fully process a typical two-hour PASEF run in under 70 min on a typical desktop (6 CPU cores, 32 GB RAM), significantly faster than other tools. Finally, through semi-enzymatic searching, we significantly increase the number of identified peptides. Within these semi-tryptic identifications, we report evidence of gas-phase fragmentation before MS/MS analysis.	Yu F.|Haynes S.E.|Teo G.C.|Avtonomov D.M.|Polasky D.A.|Nesvizhskii A.I.

Human infection by Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia (E.) coli (EHEC) occurs through the ingestion of contaminated foods such as milk, vegetable products, water-based drinks, and particularly minced meats. Indeed EHEC is a pathogen that threatens public health and meat industry. The potential of different Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strains to control EHEC in a meat-based medium was evaluated by using a simple and rapid method and by analyzing the growth kinetics of co-cultures (LAB-EHEC) in a meat-based medium. The activity of LAB toward EHEC in co-cultures showed variable inhibitory effect. Although, LAB were able to control EHEC, neither the produced acid nor bacteriocins were responsible of the inhibition. The bacteriocinogenic Enteroccus (Ent.) mundtii CRL35 presented one of the highest inhibition activities. A proteomic approach was used to evaluate bacterial interaction and antagonistic mechanisms between Ent. mundtii and EHEC. Physiological observations, such as growth kinetics, acidification ability and EHEC inhibitory potential were supported by the proteomic results, demonstrating significant differences in protein expression in LAB: (i) due to the presence of the pathogen and (ii) according to the growth phase analyzed. Most of the identified proteins belonged to carbohydrate/amino acid metabolism, energy production, transcription/translation, and cell division. These results contribute to the knowledge of competition strategies used by Ent. mundtii during its co-culture with EHEC setting new perspectives for the use of LAB to control this pathogen in meat.

Background: Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that can cause acute renal failure, especially in children. Clinical microbiology laboratories may fail to detect STEC and other diarrhoeic E. coli unless purposive rigorous screening procedures are followed using appropriate diagnostic technology; CHROMagar™STEC has rarely been used for isolation of African diarrhoeic E. coli hence characteristics of isolates on this medium are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of STEC and other diarrhoeic E. coli isolated on CHROMagar™STEC from stool samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory of a South African public sector tertiary care hospital. Results: In total, 733 stool samples were tested. Of these, 4.5% (33/733) possessed diarrhoeic E. coli. Of the diarrheic E. coli, 5/33 (15.2%) were STEC, 15/33 (45.5%) EAggEC, 6/33 (18.2%) atypical EPEC, 5/33 (15.2%) typical EPEC, and 1/33 (3%) DAEC. None of the STEC isolates had been identified by routine testing (based on using sorbitol media to test for E. coli O157: H7 strains and not the other STEC) in the laboratory. Of the 33 strains, 55% (95% CI = 40.8-72.7) showed resistance to ampicillin. Conclusions: CHROMagar™STEC enabled detection of tellurite - resistant diarrhoeic E. coli that would be missed using routine methods. Further studies are needed to determine the proportion and characteristics of those which might have been missed using this approach.	Kalule J.B.|Keddy K.H.|Nicol M.P.

The global proteomic regulation and the mechanism of biomolecule evolution in acid and alkaline ecosystems triggered by tetracycline, a representative of antibiotics, are not clear. To reveal the related mechanisms, the global responses of Escherichia (E.) coli to tetracycline in acid and alkaline conditions were analyzed using a proteomic approach. The specific phospholipid C16:1ω9c showed a significant decrease between the treatment and control groups. The 77 and 111 upregulated proteins in E. coli in acid and alkaline groups were mainly involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism and energy metabolism, whereas, the 78 downregulated proteins were related to ribosome and bacterial chemotaxis in the acid group. The 110 downregulated proteins involved in carbon, glycine, serine, threonine, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism, biosynthesis of antibiotics, fatty acids, and secondary metabolites in the alkaline group. Protein sequence analysis showed that the respective distribution of phosphorylation, glycosylation, and methylation sites among stable-expressed, upregulated, and downregulated proteins all showed a significant difference. TolC and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) in E. coli could be biomarkers to reflect tetracycline stress under extreme conditions with high sequence homology in Homo sapiens, implying the potential impact of tetracycline on humans at the network level. Generally, E. coli in the acid group accelerated the highly efficient protection mechanism to defend against tetracycline stress, while E. coli in the alkaline group strongly impaired the protection mechanism. These findings provide important clues to reveal the microbial antibiotic resistance mechanism in E. coli under extreme conditions and perfect the antibiotic usage.

Palmitoylation has been recently identified as an important post-translational rheostat for controlling protein function in eukaryotes. However, the molecular machinery underlying palmitoylation remains unclear in the neglected tropical parasite, Leishmania donovani. Herein, we have identified a catalog of 20 novel palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and characterized the promastigote-specific PAT (LdPAT4) containing the canonical Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) domain. Immunofluorescence analysis using in-house generated LdPAT4-specific antibody demonstrated distinct expression of LdPAT4 in the flagellar pocket of promastigotes. Using metabolic labeling-coupled click chemistry method, the functionality of this recombinant enzyme could be authenticated in E. coli strain expressing LdPAT4-DHHC domain. This was evident by the cellular uptake of palmitic acid analogs, which could be successfully inhibited by 2-BMP, a PAT-specific inhibitor. Using CSS-Palm based in-silico proteomic analysis, we could predict up to 23 palmitoylated sites per protein in the promastigotes, and further identify distinctive palmitoylated protein clusters involved in microtubule assembly, flagella motility and vesicular trafficking. To highlight, proteins such as Flagellar Member proteins (FLAM1, FLAM5), Intraflagellar Transport proteins (IFT88), and flagellar motor assembly proteins including the Dynein family were found to be enriched. Furthermore, analysis of global palmitoylation in promastigotes using Acyl-biotin exchange purification identified a set of S-palmitoylated proteins overlapping with the in-silico proteomics data. The attenuation of palmitoylation using 2-BMP demonstrated several phenotypic alterations in the promastigotes including distorted morphology, reduced motility (flagellar loss or slow flagellar beating), and inefficient invasion of promastigotes to host macrophages. These analyses confirm the essential role of palmitoylation in promastigotes. In summary, the findings suggest that LdPAT4 acts as a functional acyltransferase that can regulate palmitoylation of proteins involved in parasite motility and invasion, thus, can serve as a potential target for designing chemotherapeutics in Visceral Leishmaniasis.

The Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) is one of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, playing key roles in energy production and carbon flux regulation. E. coli ICDH was the first bacterial enzyme shown to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. However, the effect of lysine acetylation on E. coli ICDH, which has no sequence similarity with its counterparts in eukaryotes, is still unclear. Based on previous studies of E. coli acetylome and ICDH crystal structures, eight lysine residues were selected for mutational and kinetic analyses. They were replaced with acetyllysine by the genetic code expansion strategy or substituted with glutamine as a classic approach. Although acetylation decreased the overall ICDH activity, its effects were different site by site. Deacetylation tests demonstrated that the CobB deacetylase could deacetylate ICDH both in vivo and in vitro, but CobB was only specific for lysine residues at the protein surface. On the other hand, ICDH could be acetylated by acetyl-phosphate chemically in vitro. And in vivo acetylation tests indicated that the acetylation level of ICDH was correlated with the amounts of intracellular acetyl-phosphate. This study nicely complements previous proteomic studies to provide direct biochemical evidence for ICDH acetylation.	Venkat S.|Chen H.|Stahman A.|Hudson D.|McGuire P.|Gan Q.|Fan C.

An iTRAQ-based comparative and quantitative proteomics analysis of a soil-borne Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, Escherichia coli MB266, was conducted during the exponential and stationary growth phases. A total of 1850 proteins were identified in 4 samples, of which 373 and 456 proteins were significantly up- or down-regulated in at least one pairwise comparison, respectively. The iTRAQ data indicated that several enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism (i.e., FabA, FabD and FabZ) and pyruvate metabolism (particularly pyruvate oxidase PoxB) were significantly up-regulated, while those related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (such as FrdB, FumB and AcnA) and methylcitrate cycle (i.e., PrpC) were inactivated in the presence of 1 mM Mn(II); the amounts of some stress response and signal transduction system-related proteins (i.e., Spy) were remarkably increased, and the cold shock protein CspD was significantly up-regulated during the exponential growth phase. However, all verified heat shock proteins remained unchanged. The reactive oxygen species response and some redox enzymes might also be involved in Mn oxidation processes. The involvement of several cellular proteins in Mn(II) oxidation, including PoxB, Spy and MCO266, was further confirmed by gene disruption and expression complementation experiments. Based on these results, a signal transduction mechanism coupled to Mn oxidation was proposed.	Wang Z.|Wang J.|Liu J.|Chen H.|Li M.|Li L.

Considering as one of the major goals in quantitative proteomics, detection of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) plays an important role in biomarker selection and clinical diagnostics. There have been plenty of algorithms and tools focusing on DEP detection in proteomics research. However, due to the different application scopes of these methods, and various kinds of experiment designs, it is not very apparent about the best choice for large-scale proteomics data analyses. Moreover, given the fact that proteomics data usually contain high percentage of missing values (MVs), but few replicates, a systematic evaluation of the DEP detection methods combined with the MV imputation methods is essential and urgent. Here, we analyzed a total of four representative imputation methods and five DEP methods on different experimental and simulated datasets. The results showed that (i) MV imputation could not always improve the performances of DEP detection methods and the imputation effects differed in the missing value percentages; (ii) the DEP detection methods had different statistical powers affected by the percentage of MVs. Two statistical methods (i.e. the empirical Bayesian random censoring threshold model, and the significance analysis of microarray) performed better than the other evaluated methods in terms of accuracy and sensitivity.

Feverfew (Parthenium hysterophorus), an invasive weed from the Asteraceae family, has been reported as allergen source. Despite its relevance, knowledge of allergens is restricted to a partial sequence of a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein. We aimed to obtain the entire sequence for recombinant production and characterize feverfew pollen using proteomics and immunological assays. Par h 1, a defensin-proline fusion allergen was obtained by cDNA cloning and recombinantly produced in E. coli. Using two complementary proteomic strategies, a total of 258 proteins were identified in feverfew pollen among those 47 proteins belonging to allergenic families. Feverfew sensitized patients' sera from India revealed IgE reactivity with a pectate lyase, PR-1 protein and thioredoxin in immonoblot. In ELISA, recombinant Par h 1 was recognized by 60 and 40% of Austrian and Indian sera, respectively. Inhibition assays demonstrated the presence of IgE cross-reactive Par h 1, pectate lyase, lipid-transfer protein, profilin and polcalcin in feverfew pollen. This study reveals significant data on the allergenic composition of feverfew pollen and makes recombinant Par h 1 available for cross-reactivity studies. Feverfew might become a global player in weed pollen allergy and inclusion of standardized extracts in routine allergy diagnosis is suggested in exposed populations.

High pressure carbon dioxide (HPCD) could cause sublethally injured cells (SICs), which may cause food poisoning and spoilage during food storage and limit its application. Therefore, the formation of SICs of Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated by isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic methods in this study for better controlling the SICs induced by HPCD. A total of 2,446 proteins was identified by iTRAQ, of which 93 and 29 were significantly differentially expressed in the SICs compared with live control cells (CKL) and dead control cells (CKD), respectively. Among the 93 differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the SICs compared with CKL, 65 proteins showed down-regulation and 28 showed up-regulation. According to the comprehensive proteome coverage analysis, the SICs survived under HPCD by reducing carbohydrate decomposing, lipid transport and metabolism, amino acid transport and metabolism, transcription and translation, DNA replication and repair. Besides, the SICs showed stress response, DNA damage response and an increased carbohydrate transport, peptidoglycan synthesis and disulfide bond formation to HPCD. Among the 29 DEP in the SICs compared with CKD, 12 proteins showed down-regulation and 17 showed up-regulation. According to the comprehensive proteome coverage analysis, the SICs survived under HPCD by accumulation of cell protective agents like carbohydrates and amino acids, and decreasing transcription and translation activities. Results showed that the formation of the SICs with low metabolic activity and high survival ability was a survival strategy for E. coli O157:H7 against HPCD.	Bi X.|Wang Y.|Hu X.|Liao X.

Organophosphorus esters (OPEs) are emerging contaminants widely applied as annexing agents in a variety of industrial products, and they are robust against conventional wastewater treatments. Ultraviolet-driven (UV) radical-based advanced oxidation processes have a potential to become cost-effective treatment technologies for the removal of OPEs in water matrix, but residual and newly generated toxicities of degradation products are a concern. This study is a comprehensive attempt to evaluate UV/H2O2 for the degradation of a water dissolved OPE, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). In ultrapure water, a pseudo-first order reaction was observed, and the degradation rate constant reached 0.155 min−1 for 3.5 μM TCEP using 7.0 mW cm−2 UV irradiation with 44.0 μM H2O2. Hydroxyl radicals were involved in the oxidative degradation of TCEP, as demonstrated by the quenching of the degradation reaction in the presences of tertiary butanol or ethanol. High resolution mass spectroscopy data showed a partial transformation of TCEP to a series of hydroxylated and dechlorinated products e.g., C4H9Cl2O4P, C6H13Cl2O5P and C2H6ClO4P. Based on proteomics data at molecular and metabolic network levels, the toxicity of TCEP products was reduced obviously as the reaction proceeded, which was confirmed by the up-regulated tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism in Escherichia coli cells exposed to degradation products mixture. In conclusion, incomplete hydroxylation and dechlorination of TCEP likewise are effective for its detoxification, indicating that UV/H2O2 can be a promising treatment method for OPEs removal.

The studies of protein methylation mainly focus on lysine and arginine residues due to their diverse roles in essential cellular processes from gene expression to signal transduction. Nevertheless, atypical protein methylation occurring on amino acid residues, such as glutamine and glutamic acid, is largely neglected until recently. In addition, the systematic analysis for the distribution of methylation on different amino acids in various species is still lacking, which hinders our understanding of its functional roles. In this study, we deeply explored the methylated sites in three species Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and HeLa cells by employing MS-based proteomic approach coupled with heavy methyl SILAC method. We identify a total of 234 methylated sites on 187 proteins with high localization confidence, including 94 unreported methylated sites on nine different amino acid residues. KEGG and gene ontology analysis show the pathways enriched with methylated proteins are mainly involved in central metabolism for E. coli and S. cerevisiae, but related to spliceosome for HeLa cells. The analysis of methylation preference on different amino acids is conducted in three species. Protein N-terminal methylation is dominant in E. coli while methylated lysines and arginines are widely identified in S. cerevisiae and HeLa cells, respectively. To study whether some atypical protein methylation has biological relevance in the pathological process in mammalian cells, we focus on histone methylation in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse. Two glutamate methylation sites showed statistical significance in DIO mice compared with chow-fed mice, suggesting their potential roles in diabetes and obesity. Together, these findings expanded the methylome database from microbes to mammals, which will benefit our further appreciation for the protein methylation as well as its possible functions on disease.

Protein C-termini study is still a challenging task and far behind its counterpart, N-termini study. MS based C-terminomics study is often hampered by the low ionization efficiency of C-terminal peptides and the lack of efficient enrichment methods. We previously optimized the C-terminal amine-based isotope labeling of substrates (C-TAILS) method and identified 369 genuine protein C-termini in Escherichia coli. A key limitation of C-TAILS is that the prior protection of amines and carboxylic groups at protein level makes Arg-C as the only specific enzyme in practice. Herein, we report an approach combining multi-enzyme digestion and C-TAILS, which significantly increases the identification rate of C-terminal peptides and consequently improves the applicability of C-TAILS in biological studies. We carry out a systematic study and confirm that the omission of the prior amine protection at protein level has a negligible influence and allows the application of multi-enzyme digestion. We successfully apply five different enzyme digestions to C-TAILS, including trypsin, Arg-C, Lys-C, Lys-N, and Lysarginase. As a result, we identify a total of 722 protein C-termini in E. coli, which is at least 66% more than the results using any single enzyme. Moreover, the favored enzyme and enzyme combination are discovered. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004275.

Aim: In this study, the effects of the addition of salt to treatment with acids (one of several organic acids and salt in various solutions including rich or minimal broth, buffer, or distilled water) on the reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 were investigated. The protein expression profiles corresponding to acid stress (acetic acid) with or without salt addition were studied using a comparative proteomic analysis of E. coli O157:H7. Methods and Results: When acetic, lactic, or propionic acid was combined with 3% NaCl, mutually antagonistic effects of acid and salt on viability of E. coli O157:H7 were observed only in tryptone and yeast extract broth. After exposure to acetic acid alone or in combination with salt, approximately 851 and 916 protein spots were detected, respectively. Analysis of 10 statistically significant differentially expressed proteins revealed that these proteins are mainly related to energy metabolism. Conclusions: When we compared protein expression of E. coli O157:H7 treated with acetic acid and the combination of the acid and salt, the differentially expressed proteins were not related to acid stress- and salt stress-inducible proteins such as stress shock proteins. Significance and Impact of the Study: According to these results, the increased resistance of E. coli O157:H7 to acetic acid after the addition of salt may not be the result of synthesis of proteins related to these phenomena; therefore, further research needs to be conducted to identify the mechanism of the mutually antagonistic effect of some organic acids and salt.

Bacterial cell envelope protein (CEP) complexes mediate a range of processes, including membrane assembly, antibiotic resistance and metabolic coordination. However, only limited characterization of relevant macromolecules has been reported to date. Here we present a proteomic survey of 1,347 CEPs encompassing 90% inner- and outer-membrane and periplasmic proteins of Escherichia coli. After extraction with non-denaturing detergents, we affinity-purified 785 endogenously tagged CEPs and identified stably associated polypeptides by precision mass spectrometry. The resulting high-quality physical interaction network, comprising 77% of targeted CEPs, revealed many previously uncharacterized heteromeric complexes. We found that the secretion of autotransporters requires translocation and the assembly module TamB to nucleate proper folding from periplasm to cell surface through a cooperative mechanism involving the β-barrel assembly machinery. We also establish that an ABC transporter of unknown function, YadH, together with the Mla system preserves outer membrane lipid asymmetry. This E. coli CEP 'interactome' provides insights into the functional landscape governing CE systems essential to bacterial growth, metabolism and drug resistance.

Bacteria in the genus Cellulomonas are well known as secretors of a variety of mesophilic carbohydrate degrading enzymes (e.g., cellulases and hemicellulases), active against plant cell wall polysaccharides. Recent proteomic analysis of the mesophilic bacterium Cellulomonas fimi ATCC484 revealed uncharacterized enzymes for the hydrolysis of plant cell wall biomass. Celf-1230 (CfCel6C), a secreted protein of Cellulomonas fimi ATCC484, is a novel member of the GH6 family of cellulases that could be successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. This enzyme displayed very little enzymatic/hydrolytic activity at 30 °C, but showed an optimal activity around 65 °C, and exhibited a thermal denaturation temperature of 74 °C. In addition, it also strongly bound to filter paper despite having no recognizable carbohydrate binding module.

The apparent mislocalization or excretion of cytoplasmic proteins is a commonly observed phenomenon in both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, reports on the mechanistic basis and the cellular function of this so-called “nonclassi-cal protein secretion” are limited. Here we report that protein overexpression in recombinant cells and antibiotic-induced translation stress in wild-type Escherichia coli cells both lead to excretion of cytoplasmic protein (ECP). Condition-specific metabolomic and proteomic analyses, combined with genetic knockouts, indicate a role for both the large mechanosensitive channel (MscL) and the alternative ribosome rescue factor A (ArfA) in ECP. Collectively, the findings indicate that MscL-dependent protein excretion is positively regulated in response to both osmotic stress and arfA-mediated translational stress.IMPORTANCE Protein translocation is an essential feature of cellular organisms. Bacteria, like all single-cell organisms, interact with their environment by translocation of proteins across their cell membranes via dedicated secretion pathways. Proteins destined for secretion are directed toward the secretion pathways by the presence of specific signal peptides. This study demonstrates that under conditions of both osmotic stress and translation stress, E. coli cells undergo an excretion phenomenon whereby signal peptide-less proteins are translocated across both the inner and outer cell membranes into the extracellular environment. Confirming the presence of alternative translocation/excretion pathways and understanding their function and regulation are thus important for fundamental microbiology and biotechnology.

The underlying mechanism and cellular responses of bacteria against toxic cadmium ions is still not fully understood. Herein, Escherichia coli TG1 expressing hexahistidine- green fluorescent protein (His6GFP) and cells expressing polyhistidine-fused to the outer membrane protein A (His-OmpA) were applied as models to investigate roles of cytoplasmic metal complexation and metal chelation at the surface membrane, respec- tively, upon exposure to cadmium stress. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry-based protein identification had successfully revealed the low level expression of antioxidative enzymes and stress-responsive proteins such as manganese- superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; +1.65 fold), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC; +1:03 fold) and DNA starvation/stationary phase protection protein (Dps; -1.02 fold) in cells expressing His6GFP in the presence of 0.2 mM cadmium ions. By contrarily, cadmium exposure led to the up-regulation of MnSOD of up to C7:20 and C3:08 fold in TG1-carrying pUC19 control plasmid and TG1 expressing native GFP, respectively, for defensive purposes against Cd-induced oxidative cell damage. Our findings strongly support the idea that complex formation between cadmium ions and His6GFP could prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by interaction between Cd2+ and electron transport chain. This coincided with the evidence that cells expressing His6GFP could maintain their growth pattern in a similar fashion as that of the control cells even in the presence of harmful cadmium. Interestingly, overexpression of either OmpA or His-OmpA in E. coli cells has also been proven to confer protection against cadmium toxicity as comparable to that observed in cells expressing His6GFP. Blockage of metal uptake as a consequence of anchored polyhistidine residues on surface membrane limited certain amount of cadmium ions in which some portion could pass through and exert their toxic effects to cells as observed by the increased expression of MnSOD of up to +9:91 and +3:31 fold in case of TG1 expressing only OmpA and His- OmpA, respectively. Plausible mechanisms of cellular responses and protein mapping in the presence of cadmium ions were discussed. Taken together, we propose that the intracellular complexation of cadmium ions by metal-binding regions provides more efficiency to cope with cadmium stress than the blockage of metal uptake at the surface membrane. Such findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism and cellular adaptation against cadmium toxicity in bacteria.

AAA + proteases (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) shape the cellular protein pool in response to environmental conditions. A prerequisite for understanding the underlying recognition and degradation principles is the identification of as many protease substrates as possible. Most previous studies made use of inactive protease variants to trap substrates, which were identified by 2D-gel based proteomics. Since this method is known for limitations in the identification of low-abundant proteins or proteins with many transmembrane domains, we established a trapping approach that overcomes these limitations. We used a proteolytically inactive FtsH variant (FtsH trap ) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that is still able to bind and translocate substrates into the proteolytic chamber but no longer able to degrade proteins. Proteins associated with FtsH trap or FtsH wt (proteolytically active FtsH) were purified, concentrated by an 1D-short gel, and identified by LC-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) followed by label-free quantification. The identification of four known FtsH substrates validated this approach and suggests that it is generally applicable to AAA + proteases.

Posttranslational modifications, such as Nε-lysine acetylation, regulate protein function. Nε-lysine acetylation can occur either nonenzymatically or enzymatically. The nonenzymatic mechanism uses acetyl phosphate (AcP) or acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) as acetyl donor to modify an Nε-lysine residue of a protein. The enzymatic mechanism uses Nε-lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) to specifically transfer an acetyl group from AcCoA to Nε-lysine residues on proteins. To date, only one KAT (YfiQ, also known as Pka and PatZ) has been identified in Escherichia coli. Here, we demonstrate the existence of 4 additional E. coli KATs: RimI, YiaC, YjaB, and PhnO. In a genetic background devoid of all known acetylation mechanisms (most notably AcP and YfiQ) and one deacetylase (CobB), overexpression of these putative KATs elicited unique patterns of protein acetylation. We mutated key active site residues and found that most of them eliminated enzymatic acetylation activity. We used mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the specificity of YfiQ and the four novel KATs. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed a high degree of substrate specificity. The overlap between KAT-dependent and AcP-dependent acetylation was extremely limited, supporting the hypothesis that these two acetylation mechanisms play distinct roles in the posttranslational modification of bacterial proteins. We further showed that these novel KATs are conserved across broad swaths of bacterial phylogeny. Finally, we determined that one of the novel KATs (YiaC) and the known KAT (YfiQ) can negatively regulate bacterial migration. Together, these results emphasize distinct and specific nonenzymatic and enzymatic protein acetylation mechanisms present in bacteria. IMPORTANCE Nε-Lysine acetylation is one of the most abundant and important posttranslational modifications across all domains of life. One of the best-studied effects of acetylation occurs in eukaryotes, where acetylation of histone tails activates gene transcription. Although bacteria do not have true histones, Nε-lysine acetylation is prevalent; however, the role of these modifications is mostly unknown. We constructed an E. coli strain that lacked both known acetylation mechanisms to identify four new Nε-lysine acetyltransferases (RimI, YiaC, YjaB, and PhnO). We used mass spectrometry to determine the substrate specificity of these acetyltransferases. Structural analysis of selected substrate proteins revealed site-specific preferences for enzymatic acetylation that had little overlap with the preferences of the previously reported acetyl-phosphate nonenzymatic acetylation mechanism. Finally, YiaC and YfiQ appear to regulate flagellum-based motility, a phenotype critical for pathogenesis of many organisms. These acetyltransferases are highly conserved and reveal deeper and more complex roles for bacterial posttranslational modification.

Objective: Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key component of several major human diseases, but the molecular basis of this complex disorder has been difficult to determine in vivo. Previous attempts to identify key mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction in experimental models have been limited by the lack of suitable methods for system-wide analyses of vascular bed biology. Here, we aimed to develop a novel method for investigating vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis that enables system-wide analyses of molecular interactions between endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in murine. Approach and Results: We developed a new technique using whole-body differential perfusion with increasing concentrations of detergent buffer to selectively solubilize distinct layers of vascular bed tissue in rodents. When combined with proteomics techniques, our novel approach of differential systemic decellularization in vivo enabled quantitative profiling of vascular beds throughout the body. Initial perfusion with phosphate buffer was used to obtain the endothelial glycocalyx, followed by subsequent extraction of endothelial cell components, and finally by smooth muscle cell constituents with increasing concentrations of detergent. Differential systemic decellularization in vivo has also been successfully applied to characterize molecular events in the vascular bed pathology of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice. Conclusions: Together, these data indicate that differential systemic decellularization in vivo permits system-wide molecular characterization of vascular bed proteomes in rodent models and can be used to advance our current understanding of vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis and progression in a wide range of disease settings.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections are an important cause of diarrhea among young children living in low- and middle-income countries and visiting travelers. The development of effective vaccines is complicated by substantial genomic diversity that exists among ETEC isolates. To investigate how ETEC genomic variation is reflected at expressed proteome level, we applied label-free quantitative proteomics to seven human ETEC strains representing five epidemiologically important lineages. We further determined the proteome profile of the nonpathogenic E. coli B strain BL21(DE3) to discriminate features specific for ETEC. The analysis yielded a data set of 2893 proteins, of which 1729 were present in all strains. Each ETEC strain produced on average 27 plasmid- or chromosomally-encoded proteins with known or putative connections to virulence, and a number of strain-specific proteins associated with the biosynthesis of surface antigens. Statistical comparison of protein levels between the ETEC strains and BL21(DE3) revealed several proteins with considerably increased levels only in BL21(DE3) including enzymes of arginine biosynthesis and metabolism of melibiose, galactitol, and gluconate. ETEC strains displayed consistently increased levels of proteins that were functional in iron acquisition, maltose metabolism, and acid resistance. The latter results suggest that specific metabolic functions might be shared among ETEC isolates.	Pettersen V.K.|Steinsland H.|Wiker H.G.

Recent advances in proteomics and genomics have enabled discovery of thousands of previously nonannotated small open reading frames (smORFs) in genomes across evolutionary space. Furthermore, quantitative mass spectrometry has recently been applied to analysis of regulated smORF expression. However, bottom-up proteomics has remained relatively insensitive to membrane proteins, suggesting they may have been underdetected in previous studies. In this report, we add biochemical membrane protein enrichment to our previously developed label-free quantitative proteomics protocol, revealing a never-before-identified heat shock protein in Escherichia coli K12. This putative smORF-encoded heat shock protein, GndA, is likely to be ∼36-55 amino acids in length and contains a predicted transmembrane helix. We validate heat shock-regulated expression of the gndA smORF and demonstrate that a GndA-GFP fusion protein cofractionates with the cell membrane. Quantitative membrane proteomics therefore has the ability to reveal nonannotated small proteins that may play roles in bacterial stress responses.	Yuan P.|D'Lima N.|Slavoff S.

The Escherichia coli SMC complex, MukBEF, acts in chromosome segregation. MukBEF shares the distinctive architecture of other SMC complexes, with one prominent difference; unlike other kleisins, MukF forms dimers through its N-terminal domain. We show that a 4-helix bundle adjacent to the MukF dimerisation domain interacts functionally with the MukB coiled-coiled ‘neck’ adjacent to the ATPase head. We propose that this interaction leads to an asymmetric tripartite complex, as in other SMC complexes. Since MukF dimerisation is preserved during this interaction, MukF directs the formation of dimer of dimer MukBEF complexes, observed previously in vivo. The MukF N-and C-terminal domains stimulate MukB ATPase independently and additively. We demonstrate that impairment of the MukF interaction with MukB in vivo leads to ATP hydrolysis-dependent release of MukBEF complexes from chromosomes.

Background: L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) is an essential amino acid for mammals and applications expand into human health and nutritional products. In this study, a system level engineering was conducted to enhance L-Phe biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Results: We inactivated the PTS system and recruited glucose uptake via combinatorial modulation of galP and glk to increase PEP supply in the Xllp01 strain. In addition, the HTH domain of the transcription factor TyrR was engineered to decrease the repression on the transcriptional levels of L-Phe pathway enzymes. Finally, proteomics analysis demonstrated the third step of the SHIK pathway (catalyzed via AroD) as the rate-limiting step for L-Phe production. After optimization of the aroD promoter strength, the titer of L-Phe increased by 13.3%. Analysis of the transcriptional level of genes involved in the central metabolic pathways and L-Phe biosynthesis via RT-PCR showed that the recombinant L-Phe producer exhibited a great capability in the glucose utilization and precursor (PEP and E4P) generation. Via systems level engineering, the L-Phe titer of Xllp21 strain reached 72.9 g/L in a 5 L fermenter under the non-optimized fermentation conditions, which was 1.62-times that of the original strain Xllp01. Conclusion: The metabolic engineering strategy reported here can be broadly employed for developing genetically defined organisms for the efficient production of other aromatic amino acids and derived compounds.

S-nitrosylation, the oxidative modification of Cys residues by nitric oxide (NO) to form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), modifies all main classes of proteins and provides a fundamental redox-based cellular signaling mechanism. However, in contrast to other post-translational protein modifications, S-nitrosylation is generally considered to be non-enzymatic, involving multiple chemical routes. We report here that endogenous protein S-nitrosylation in the model organism E. coli depends principally upon the enzymatic activity of the hybrid cluster protein Hcp, employing NO produced by nitrate reductase. Anaerobiosis on nitrate induces both Hcp and nitrate reductase, thereby resulting in the S-nitrosylation-dependent assembly of a large interactome including enzymes that generate NO (NO synthase), synthesize SNO-proteins (SNO synthase), and propagate SNO-based signaling (trans-nitrosylases) to regulate cell motility and metabolism. Thus, protein S-nitrosylation by NO in E. coli is essentially enzymatic, and the potential generality of the multiplex enzymatic mechanism that we describe may support a re-conceptualization of NO-based cellular signaling. Protein S-nitrosylation by nitric oxide is generally thought to be non-enzymatic. Seth et al. demonstrate that endogenous S-nitrosylation in E. coli depends upon enzymatic activity of the hybrid cluster protein Hcp and involves assembly of an Hcp interactome including enzymes that generate NO, synthesize SNO-proteins, and propagate SNO-based signaling.

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the E. coli proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 E. coli strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.	Qi F.|Motz M.|Jung K.|Lassak J.|Frishman D.

Glycoside phosphorylases (EC 2.4.x.x) carry out the reversible phosphorolysis of glucan polymers, producing the corresponding sugar 1-phosphate and a shortened glycan chain.β-1,3-Glucan phosphorylase activities have been reported in the photosynthetic euglenozoan Euglena gracilis, but the cognate protein sequences have not been identified to date. Continuing our efforts to understand the glycobiology of E. gracilis, we identified a candidate phosphorylase sequence, designated EgP1, by proteomic analysis of an enriched cellular protein lysate. We expressed recombinant EgP1 in Escherichia coli and characterized it in vitro as a β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase. BLASTP identified several hundred EgP1 orthologs, most of which were from Gram-negative bacteria and had 37-91% sequence identity to EgP1. We heterologously expressed a bacterial metagenomic sequence, Pro-7066 in E. coli and confirmed it as aβ-1,3-glucan phosphorylase, albeit with kinetics parameters distinct from those of EgP1. EgP1, Pro-7066, and their orthologs are classified as a new glycoside hydrolase (GH) family, designated GH149. Comparisons between GH94, EgP1, and Pro-7066 sequences revealed conservation of key amino acids required for the phosphorylase activity, suggesting a phosphorylase mechanism that is conserved between GH94 and GH149. We found bacterial GH149 genes in gene clusters containing sugar transporter and several other GH family genes, suggesting that bacterial GH149 proteins have roles in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. The Bacteroidetes GH149 genes located to previously identified polysaccharide utilization loci, implicated in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. In summary, we have identified a eukaryotic and a bacterial β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase and uncovered a new family of phosphorylases that we name GH149.

The carbohydrate-uptake phosphorelay PTS system plays a key role in metabolic regulation in Bacteria controlling the utilization of secondary carbon sources. Some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, encode a paralogous system named PTS Ntr (nitrogen related PTS). PTS Ntr is composed of EI Ntr (ptsP), NPr (ptsO), and EIIA Ntr (ptsN). These proteins act as a phosphorelay system from phosphoenolpyruvate to EI Ntr , NPr and them to EIIA Ntr . PTS Ntr is not involved in carbohydrate uptake and it may be dedicated to performing regulatory functions. The phosphorylation state of EI Ntr is regulated by allosteric binding of glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate, metabolites whose intracellular levels reflect the nitrogen status. Although PTS Ntr is designated as having nitrogen-sensory properties, no major effect of this system on nitrogen regulation has been described in E. coli. Here we show that an E. coli ptsN deletion mutant has impaired growth in minimal medium. Proteome analysis of the ∆ ptsN strain under different nitrogen regimes revealed no involvement in regulation of the canonical nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system. The proteomic data support the conclusion that ptsN is required to balance the activities of the sigma factors RpoS and RpoD in such way that, in the absence of ptsN, RpoS-dependent genes are preferentially expressed. Significance The nitrogen related PTS Ntr phosphorelay system has been hypothesized to participate in the control of nitrogen metabolism. Here we used a proteomics approach to show that an Escherichia coli ptsN null strain, which misses the final module of PTS Ntr phosphorelay, has no significant effects on nitrogen metabolism under different nitrogen regimes. We noted that ptsN is required for fitness under minimal medium and for the proper balance between RpoS and sigma 70 activities in such way that, in the absence of ptsN, RpoS-dependent genes are preferentially expressed.

Bacteria respond to stressful growth conditions through a conserved phenomenon of stringent response mediated by synthesis of stress alarmones ppGpp and pppGpp [referred to as (p)ppGpp]. (p)ppGpp synthesis is known to occur by ribosome-associated RelA. In addition, a dual-function protein, SpoT (with both synthetase and hydrolase activities), maintains (p)ppGpp homeostasis. The presence of (p)ppGpp is also known to contribute to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Mycobacterium smegmatis possesses Arr, which inactivates rifampin by its ADP ribosylation. Arr has been shown to be upregulated in response to stress. However, the roles Arr might play during growth have remained unclear. We show that Arr confers growth fitness advantage to M. smegmatis even in the absence of rifampin. Arr deficiency in M. smegmatis resulted in deficiency of biofilm formation. Further, we show that while Arr does not interact with the wild-type Escherichia coli ribosomes, it interacts with them when the E. coli ribosomal protein L11 (a stringent response regulator) is replaced with its homolog from M. smegmatis. The Arr interaction with E. coli ribosomes occurs even when the N-terminal 33 amino acids of its L11 protein were replaced with the corresponding sequence of M. smegmatis L11 (Msm-EcoL11 chimeric protein). Interestingly, Arr interaction with the E. coli ribosomes harboring M. smegmatis L11 or Msm-EcoL11 results in the synthesis of ppGpp in vivo. Our study shows a novel role of antibiotic resistance gene arr in stress response.	Agrawal P.|Varada R.|Sah S.|Bhattacharyya S.|Varshney U.

Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (TopA), a regulator of global and local DNA supercoiling, is modified by N-Lysine acetylation. The NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase CobB can reverse both enzymatic and non-enzymatic lysine acetylation modification in E. coli. Here, we show that the absence of CobB in a ΔcobB mutant reduces intracellular TopA catalytic activity and increases negative DNA supercoiling. TopA expression level is elevated as topA transcription responds to the increased negative supercoiling. The slow growth phenotype of the ΔcobB mutant can be partially compensated by further increase of intracellular TopA level via overexpression of recombinant TopA. The relaxation activity of purified TopA is decreased by in vitro non-enzymatic acetyl phosphate mediated lysine acetylation, and the presence of purified CobB protects TopA from inactivation by such non-enzymatic acetylation. The specific activity of TopA expressed from His-tagged fusion construct in the chromosome is inversely proportional to the degree of in vivo lysine acetylation during growth transition and growth arrest. These findings demonstrate that E. coli TopA catalytic activity can be modulated by lysine acetylation-deacetylation, and prevention of TopA inactivation from excess lysine acetylation and consequent increase in negative DNA supercoiling is an important physiological function of the CobB protein deacetylase.

In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the toxic impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on Escherichia coli starts at 10 ppm and is closely related to the presence of little aggregates. It was also assumed that only a part of the bacterial population is able to adapt to this stress and attempts to survive. Proteomic analyses, supported by results from metabolomics, reveal that exposure of E. coli to nano-TiO2 induces two main effects on bacterial metabolism: Firstly, the up-regulation of proteins and the increase of metabolites related to energy and growth metabolism; secondly, the down-regulation of other proteins resulting in an increase of metabolites, particularly amino acids. Some proteins, e.g. chaperonin 1 or isocitrate dehydrogenase, and some metabolites, e.g. phenylalanine or valine, might be used as biomarkers of nanoparticles stress. Astonishingly, the ATP content gradually rises in relation with the nano-TiO2 concentration in the medium, indicating a dramatic release of ATP by the damaged cells. These apparently contradictory results accredit the thesis of a heterogeneity of the bacterial population. This heterogeneity is also confirmed by SEM images which show that while some bacteria are fully covered by nano-TiO2, the major part of the bacterial population remains free from nanoparticles, resulting in a difference of proteome and metabolome. The use of combined±omics has allowed to better understand the heterogeneous bacterial response to nano-TiO2 stress due to heterogeneous contacts between the protagonists under environmental conditions.

Methods for rapid and reliable microbial identification are essential in modern healthcare. The ability to detect and correctly identify pathogenic species and their resistance phenotype is necessary for accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment of infectious diseases. Bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics enables rapid characterization of large parts of the expressed genes of microorganisms. However, the generated data are highly fragmented, making downstream analyses complex. Here we present TCUP, a new computational method for typing and characterizing bacteria using proteomics data from bottom-up tandem MS. TCUP compares the generated protein sequence data to reference databases and automatically finds peptides suitable for characterization of taxonomic composition and identification of expressed antimicrobial resistance genes. TCUP was evaluated using several clinically relevant bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae), using both simulated data generated by in silico peptide digestion and experimental proteomics data generated by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The results showed that TCUP performs correct peptide classifications at rates between 90.3 and 98.5% at the species level. The method was also able to estimate the relative abundances of individual species in mixed cultures. Furthermore, TCUP could identify expressed β-lactamases in an extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing (ESBL) E. coli strain, even when the strain was cultivated in the absence of antibiotics. Finally, TCUP is computationally efficient, easy to integrate in existing bioinformatics workflows, and freely available under an open source license for both Windows and Linux environments.

A surface-confined aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (SCARAFT) polymerization method was developed to coat capillaries for use in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). SCARAFT polymerization primarily takes place on the inner surface of the capillary instead of in solution, which greatly improves the homogeneity of the coating. Capillaries treated with this coating produced an electroosmotic mobility of 2.8 ± 0.2 × 10-6 cm2·V-1·s-1 (N = 3), which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than that of commercial linear polyacrylamide (LPA)-coated capillaries. Coated capillaries were evaluated for bottom-up proteomic analysis using CZE. The very low electroosmotic mobility results in a 200 min separation and improved single-shot analysis. An average of 977 protein groups and 5605 unique peptides were identified from 50 ng of an E. coli digest, and 2158 protein groups and 10 005 peptides were identified from 25 ng of a HeLa digest using single-shot analysis with a SCARAFT-acrylamide capillary coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. The coating is stable. A single capillary was used for over 200 h (8.4 days) of continuous operation. RSD in migration time was between 2 and 3% for selected ion electropherograms (SIEs) generated for six ions; median theoretical plate counts ranged from 240 000 to 600 000 for these SIEs. Various types of coatings could be prepared by simply changing the functional vinyl monomers in the polymerization mixture. Positively charged coatings using direct attachment and formation of a block copolymer were prepared and demonstrated for the separation of mixtures of intact proteins.	Zhang Z.|Peuchen E.|Dovichi N.

In order to grow and replicate, living cells must express a diverse array of proteins, but the process by which proteins are made includes a great deal of inherent randomness. Understanding this randomness - whether it arises from the discrete stochastic nature of chemical reactivity (""intrinsic"" noise), or from cell-to-cell variability in the concentrations of molecules involved in gene expression, or from the timings of important cell-cycle events like DNA replication and cell division (""extrinsic"" noise) - remains a challenge. In this article we analyze a model of gene expression that accounts for several extrinsic sources of noise, including those associated with chromosomal replication, cell division, and variability in the numbers of RNA polymerase, ribonuclease E, and ribosomes. We then attempt to fit our model to a large proteomics and transcriptomics data set and find that only through the introduction of a few key correlations among the extrinsic noise sources can we accurately recapitulate the experimental data. These include significant correlations between the rate of mRNA degradation (mediated by ribonuclease E) and the rates of both transcription (RNA polymerase) and translation (ribosomes) and, strikingly, an anticorrelation between the transcription and the translation rates themselves.

The phospholipid (PL) composition of bacterial membranes varies as a function of growth rate and in response to changes in the environment. While growth adaptation can be explained by biochemical feedback in the PL synthesis pathway, recent transcriptome studies have revealed that the expression of PL synthesis genes can also be tuned in response to various stresses. We previously showed that the BasRS two-component pathway controls the expression of the diacylglycerol kinase gene, dgkA, in Escherichia coli (A. Wahl, L. My, R. Dumoulin, J. N. Sturgis, and E. Bouveret, Mol Microbiol, 80:1260-1275, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07641.x). In this study, we set up a strategy to identify the mutation responsible for the upregulation of pssA observed in the historical pssR1 mutant and supposedly corresponding to a transcriptional repressor (C. P. Sparrow and J. Raetz, J Biol Chem, 258:9963-9967, 1983). pssA encodes phosphatidylserine synthase, the first step of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. We showed that this mutation corresponded to a single nucleotide change in the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the 16S rRNA encoded by the rrnC operon. We further demonstrated that this mutation enhanced the translation of pssA. Though this effect appeared to be restricted to PssA among phospholipid synthesis enzymes, it was not specific, as evidenced by a global effect on the production of unrelated proteins.
