"Protein–Protein Interaction Networks Derived from Classical and Machine Learning-Based Natural Language Processing Tools","Degnan, David J.; Strauch, Clayton W.; Obiri, Moses Y.; VonKaenel, Erik D.; Kim, Grace S.; Kershaw, James D.; Novelli, David L.; Pazdernik, Karl T. L.; Bramer, Lisa M.","natural language processing; relationship extraction; biological text mining; machine learning; large language models; BERT; GPT; LLM","The study of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides insight into various biological mechanisms, including the binding of antibodies to antigens, enzymes to inhibitors or promoters, and receptors to ligands. Recent studies of PPIs have led to significant biological breakthroughs. For example, the study of PPIs involved in the human:SARS-CoV-2 viral infection mechanism aided in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Though several databases exist for the manual curation of PPI networks, text mining methods have been routinely demonstrated as useful alternatives for newly studied or understudied species where databases are incomplete. Here, the relationship extraction (RE) performance of several open-source classical text processing, machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP), and large language model (LLM)-based NLP tools were compared. Overall, our results indicated that networks derived from classical methods tend to have high true positive rates at the expense of having overconnected-networks, ML-based NLP methods have lower true positive rates but networks with the closest structures to the target network, and LLM-based NLP methods tend to exist in-between the two other approaches, with variable performances. Finally, the selection of a specific NLP approach should be tied to the needs of a study and text availability, as models varied in performance due to the amount of text provided.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program","","United States","2024-11-11T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Proteome Research; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5395-5404","","PNNL-SA-199871","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 1535-3893","10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00535","","2025-01-07T05:00:00Z","2483344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2483344","","Journal of Proteome Research","12","23"
"Changes of Protein Turnover in Aging <em>Caenorhabditis elegans<\/em>","Dhondt, Ineke; Petyuk, Vladislav A.; Bauer, Sophie; Brewer, Heather M.; Smith, Richard D.; Depuydt, Geert; Braeckman, Bart P.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Protein turnover rates severely decline in aging organisms, including C. elegans. However, limited information is available on turnover dynamics at the individual protein level during aging. Here, we followed changes in protein turnover at one-day resolution using a multiple-pulse <sup>15</sup>N-labeling and accurate mass spectrometry approach. Forty percent of the proteome shows gradual slowdown in turnover with age, whereas only few proteins show increased turnover. Decrease in protein turnover was consistent for only a minority of functionally related protein subsets, including tubulins and vitellogenins, whereas randomly diverging turnover patterns with age were the norm. Our data suggests increased heterogeneity of protein turnover of the translation machinery, whereas protein turnover of ubiquitin-proteasome and antioxidant systems are well-preserved over time. Hence, we presume that maintenance of quality control mechanisms is a protective strategy in aging worms, although the ultimate proteome collapse is inescapable.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Scientific Research-Flanders, Belgium","","United States","2017-07-05T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Molecular and Cellular Proteomics; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1621-1633","","PNNL-SA-129634","AC05-76RL01830; AC05–76RL0 1830","Journal ID: ISSN 1535-9476; 49531; 453040220","10.1074/mcp.RA117.000049","","2021-07-26T04:00:00Z","1766333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1766333","","Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","9","16"

Comparison of the lipid droplet proteomes of wild type and high-fat daf-2 mutant strains shows a very similar proteome in both strains, except that the most abundant protein in the C. elegans lipid droplet proteome, MDT-28, is relatively less abundant in lipid droplets isolated from daf-2 mutants. Functional analysis of lipid droplet proteins identified in our proteomic studies indicated an enrichment of proteins required for growth and fat homeostasis in C. elegans. Finally, we confirmed the localization of one of the newly identified lipid droplet proteins, ACS-4. We found that ACS-4 localizes to the surface of lipid droplets in the C. elegans intestine and skin.

"<em>Caenorhabditis elegans<\/em> Dicer acts with the RIG-I-like helicase DRH-1 and RDE-4 to cleave dsRNA","Consalvo, Claudia D.; Aderounmu, Adedeji M.; Donelick, Helen M.; Aruscavage, P. Joseph; Eckert, Debra M.; Shen, Peter S.; Bass, Brenda L.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","Invertebrates use the endoribonuclease Dicer to cleave viral dsRNA during antiviral defense, while vertebrates use RIG-I-like Receptors (RLRs), which bind viral dsRNA to trigger an interferon response. While some invertebrate Dicers act alone during antiviral defense, Caenorhabditis elegans Dicer acts in a complex with a dsRNA binding protein called RDE-4, and an RLR ortholog called DRH-1. We used biochemical and structural techniques to provide mechanistic insight into how these proteins function together. We found RDE-4 is important for ATP-independent and ATP-dependent cleavage reactions, while helicase domains of both DCR-1 and DRH-1 contribute to ATP-dependent cleavage. DRH-1 plays the dominant role in ATP hydrolysis, and like mammalian RLRs, has an N-terminal domain that functions in autoinhibition. A cryo-EM structure indicates DRH-1 interacts with DCR-1’s helicase domain, suggesting this interaction relieves autoinhibition. Our study unravels the mechanistic basis of the collaboration between two helicases from typically distinct innate immune defense pathways.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Nevertheless, whether Aβ is the primary disease driver remains controversial. We report here that FAD mutations disrupt initial proteolytic events in the multistep processing of APP substrate C99 by γ-secretase. Cryoelectron microscopy reveals that a substrate mimetic traps γ-secretase during the transition state, and this structure aligns with activated enzyme-substrate complex captured by molecular dynamics simulations. In silico simulations and in cellulo fluorescence microscopy support stabilization of enzyme-substrate complexes by FAD mutations. Neuronal expression of C99 and/or presenilin-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to synaptic loss only with FAD-mutant transgenes. Designed mutations that stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex and block Aβ production likewise led to synaptic loss. Collectively, these findings implicate the stalled process—not the products—of γ-secretase cleavage of substrates in FAD pathogenesis.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

Tanaka","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Science & Technology; Intrinsically disordered proteins; RNA; Self-renewal; X-ray crystallography","PUF proteins are characterized by globular RNA-binding domains. They also interact with partner proteins that modulate their RNA-binding activities. Caenorhabditis elegans PUF protein fem-3 binding factor-2 (FBF-2) partners with intrinsically disordered Lateral Signaling Target-1 (LST-1) to regulate target mRNAs in germline stem cells. Here, we report that an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the C-terminus of FBF-2 autoinhibits its RNA-binding affinity by increasing the off rate for RNA binding. Moreover, the FBF-2 C-terminal region interacts with its globular RNA-binding domain at the same site where LST-1 binds. This intramolecular interaction restrains an electronegative cluster of amino acid residues near the 5' end of the bound RNA to inhibit RNA binding. LST-1 binding in place of the FBF-2 C-terminus therefore releases autoinhibition and increases RNA-binding affinity. This regulatory mechanism, driven by IDRs, provides a biochemical and biophysical explanation for the interdependence of FBF-2 and LST-1 in germline stem cell self-renewal.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

We demonstrated that UNC-5 and UNC-6/netrin form a large, stable, and rigid complex in the presence of heparin, and heparin and UNC-5 exclude the attractive UNC-40/DCC receptor from binding to UNC-6/netrin to a large extent.

Still, gene prediction in large eukaryotic genomes presents a challenge that must be addressed by new algorithms. The amount and significance of the evidence available from transcriptomes and proteomes vary across genomes, between genes, and even along a single gene. User-friendly and accurate annotation pipelines that can cope with such data heterogeneity are needed. The previously developed annotation pipelines BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 use RNA-seq or protein data, respectively, but not both. A further significant performance improvement integrating all three data types was made by the recently released GeneMark-ETP. We here present the BRAKER3 pipeline that builds on GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS, and further improves accuracy using the TSEBRA combiner. BRAKER3 annotates protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes using both short-read RNA-seq and a large protein database, along with statistical models learned iteratively and specifically for the target genome. We benchmarked the new pipeline on genomes of 11 species under an assumed level of relatedness of the target species proteome to available proteomes. BRAKER3 outperforms BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. The average transcript-level F1-score is increased by about 20 percentage points on average, whereas the difference is most pronounced for species with large and complex genomes. BRAKER3 also outperforms other existing tools, MAKER2, Funannotate, and FINDER. The code of BRAKER3 is available on GitHub and as a ready-to-run Docker container for execution with Docker or Singularity. Overall, BRAKER3 is an accurate, easy-to-use tool for eukaryotic genome annotation.","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2024-06-12T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Genome Research; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 769-777","","","AC02-05CH11231; GM128145","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9051","10.1101/gr.278090.123","","2025-03-31T04:00:00Z","2470762","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470762","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470762","Genome Research","5","34"

We purified from cow heart mitochondria an enzyme (OAT1) with OAA tautomerase (OAT) activity that converts enol-OAA to the physiological keto-OAA form, and determined that it belongs to the highly conserved and previously uncharacterized Fumarylacetoacetate_hydrolase_domain-containing protein family. From all three domains of life, heterologously expressed proteins were shown to have strong OAT activity, and ablating the OAT1 homolog caused significant growth defects. In Escherichia coli, expression of succinate dehydrogenase was necessary for OAT1-associated growth defects to occur, and ablating OAT1 caused a significant increase in acetate and other metabolites associated with anaerobic respiration. OAT1 increased the succinate dehydrogenase reaction rate by 35% in in vitro assays with physiological concentrations of both succinate and malate. Our results suggest that OAT1 is a universal metabolite repair enzyme that is required to maximize aerobic respiration efficiency by preventing succinate dehydrogenase inhibition.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE","","United States","2024-01-29T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 846","","","SC0019148","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 45134","10.1038/s41467-024-45134-0","","2025-05-12T04:00:00Z","2283115","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2283115","","Nature Communications","1","15"

In the past, whole-genome transcript profiling was used extensively to study differential gene expression in response to reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling, including expression levels of metabolism-associated genes. Taking advantage of the recent developments in quantitative liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics, we profiled the proteomic changes that occur in response to activation of the DAF-16 transcription factor in the germline-less glp-4(bn2); daf-2(e1370) receptor mutant. Strikingly, the daf-2 profile suggests extensive reorganization of intermediary metabolism, characterized by the up-regulation of many core intermediary metabolic pathways. These include, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis, pentose phosphate cycle, citric acid cycle, glyoxylate shunt, fatty acid β-oxidation, one-carbon metabolism, propionate and tyrosine catabolism, and complex I, II, III and V of the electron transport chain. Interestingly, we found simultaneous activation of reciprocally regulated metabolic pathways, which is indicative for spatio-temporal coordination of energy metabolism and/or extensive post-translational regulation of these enzymes.

Using accurate mass and time tag LCMS/MS quantitative proteomics we detected that the abundance of a large number of ribosomal subunits is decreased in response to dietary restriction as well as in the daf2(e1370) insulin/IGF1 receptor mutant. In addition, general protein synthesis levels in these long-lived worms are repressed. Surprisingly, ribosomal transcript levels were not correlated to actual protein abundance, suggesting that posttranscriptional regulation determines ribosome content. Proteomics also revealed increased presence of many structural muscle cell components in long-lived worms, which appears to result from prioritized preservation of muscle cell volume in nutrient-poor conditions or low insulin-like signaling. Activation of DAF16, but not diet-restriction, stimulates mRNA expression of muscle-related genes to prevent muscle atrophy. Important daf2 specific proteome changes include overexpression of aerobic metabolism enzymes and a general activation of stress responsive and immune defense systems, while increased abundance of many protein subunits of the proteasome core complex is a DR-specific characteristic.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Lipid droplet-associated proteins in alcohol-associated fatty liver disease: A proteomic approach","Perumal, Sathish Kumar; Day, Le Z.; Arumugam, Madan Kumar; Chava, Srinivas; Kumar, Vikas; Osna, Natalia A.; Jacobs, Jon; Rasineni, Karuna; Kharbanda, Kusum K.","","The earliest manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is steatosis characterized by deposition of fat in specialized organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). While alcohol administration causes a rise in LD numbers in the hepatocytes, little is known regarding their characteristics that allow their accumulation and size to increase. The aim of the present study is to gain insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms by investigating the ethanol-induced changes in hepatic LD proteome as a function of LD size. Adult male Wistar rats (180–200 g BW) were fed with ethanol liquid diet for 6 weeks. At sacrifice, large-, medium-, and small-sized hepatic LD subpopulations (LD1, LD2, and LD3, respectively) were isolated and subjected to morphological and proteomic analyses. Morphological analysis of LD1-LD3 fractions of ethanol-fed rats clearly demonstrated that LD1 contained larger LDs compared with LD2 and LD3 fractions. Our preliminary results from principal component analysis showed that the proteome of different-sized hepatic LD fractions was distinctly different. Proteomic data analysis identified over 2000 proteins in each LD fraction with significant alterations in protein abundance among the three LD fractions. Among the altered proteins, several were related to fat metabolism, including synthesis, incorporation of fatty acid, and lipolysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed increased fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid incorporation, LD fusion, and reduced lipolysis in LD1 compared to LD3. Overall, the proteomic findings indicate that the increased level of protein that facilitates fusion of LDs combined with an increased association of negative regulators of lipolysis dictates the generation of large-sized LDs during the development of alcohol-associated hepatic steatosis. Several significantly altered proteins were identified in different-sized LDs isolated from livers of ethanol-fed rats. Ethanol-induced increases in specific proteins that hinder LD lipid metabolism led to the accumulation and persistence of large-sized LDs in the liver.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2024-10-16T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research; Journal Volume: 48; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2010-2021","","PNNL-SA-198241","AC05-76RL01830; R01 AA026723; R01 AA028504; P50 AA030407-1531; I01BX004053; I01BX006064","Journal ID: ISSN 2993-7175","10.1111/acer.15446","","2025-03-10T04:00:00Z","2525940","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2525940","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2525940","Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research","11","48"

Accuracy results indicate that GALBA is particularly strong in the annotation of large vertebrate genomes. We also present use cases in insects, vertebrates, and a land plant. GALBA is fully open source and available as a docker image for easy execution with Singularity in high-performance computing environments. Our pipeline addresses the critical need for accurate gene annotation in newly sequenced genomes, and we believe that GALBA will greatly facilitate genome annotation for diverse organisms.","BioMed Central","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE; US National Institute of Health (NIH); German Research Foundation (DFG)","","United States","2023-08-31T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Bioinformatics; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 327","","","AC02-05CH11231; GM128145; 277249973; R01HG010040; 391397397","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2105; PII: 5449","10.1186/s12859-023-05449-z","","2025-04-07T04:00:00Z","2470966","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470966","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470966","BMC Bioinformatics","1","24"

Using Xenopus laevis, we investigated the effect of PFAS on (a) lipid homeostasis and whether this correlated to changes in body and hepatic condition; (b) the expression of hepatic genes regulated by PPAR; and (c) the hepatic lipidome. We chronically exposed tadpoles to 0.5 µg/L of either PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA, PFHxA, a binary mixture of PFOS and PFHxS (0.5 µg/L of each), or a control, from NF stage 52 through metamorphic climax. Growth, development, and survival were not affected, but we detected a sex-specific decrease in body condition at NF 66 (6.8%) and in hepatic condition (16.6%) across metamorphic climax for male tadpoles exposed to PFOS. We observed weak evidence for the transient downregulation of apolipoprotein-V (apoa5) at NF 62 in tadpoles exposed to PFHxA. Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (acox1) was downregulated only in males exposed to PFHxS (Ln(Fold Change) = −0.54). We detected PFAS-specific downregulation of structural glycerophospholipids, while semi-quantitative profiling detected the upregulation in numerous glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and diglycerides. Overall, our findings indicate that PFAS can induce sex-specific effects that change across larval development and metamorphosis. We demonstrate that PFAS alter lipid metabolism at environmentally relevant concentrations through divergent mechanisms that may not be related to PPARs, with an absence of effects on body condition, demonstrating the need for more molecular studies to elucidate mechanisms of PFAS-induced lipid dysregulation in amphibians and in other taxa.</p>","MDPI AG","","","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","Switzerland","2024-10-10T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Toxics Journal Volume: 12 Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 732","","","EM0005228","Journal ID: ISSN 2305-6304; TOXIC8; PII: toxics12100732","10.3390/toxics12100732","","2025-01-21T05:00:00Z","2503533","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2503533","","Toxics","10","12"
"Recruitment of Polo-like kinase couples synapsis to meiotic progression via inactivation of CHK-2","Zhang, Liangyu; Stauffer, Weston T.; Wang, John S.; Wu, Fan; Yu, Zhouliang; Liu, Chenshu; Kim, Hyung Jun; Dernburg, Abby F.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Life Sciences & Biomedicine","Meiotic chromosome segregation relies on synapsis and crossover (CO) recombination between homologous chromosomes. These processes require multiple steps that are coordinated by the meiotic cell cycle and monitored by surveillance mechanisms. In diverse species, failures in chromosome synapsis can trigger a cell cycle delay and/or lead to apoptosis. How this key step in ‘homolog engagement’ is sensed and transduced by meiotic cells is unknown. Here we report that in <em>C. elegans</em>, recruitment of the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 to the synaptonemal complex triggers phosphorylation and inactivation of CHK-2, an early meiotic kinase required for pairing, synapsis, and double-strand break (DSB) induction. Inactivation of CHK-2 terminates DSB formation and enables CO designation and cell cycle progression. These findings illuminate how meiotic cells ensure CO formation and accurate chromosome segregation.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2023-01-26T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: eLife; Journal Volume: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e84492","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2050-084X","10.7554/elife.84492","","2025-03-27T04:00:00Z","2470671","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470671","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470671","eLife","","12"

The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

In vitro adult screens typically assess single phenotypes without prior enrichment for chemicals with antifilarial potential. We developed a multivariate screen that identified dozens of compounds with submicromolar macrofilaricidal activity, achieving a hit rate of >50% by leveraging abundantly accessible microfilariae. Adult assays were multiplexed to thoroughly characterize compound activity across relevant parasite fitness traits, including neuromuscular control, fecundity, metabolism, and viability. Seventeen compounds from a diverse chemogenomic library elicited strong effects on at least one adult trait, with differential potency against microfilariae and adults. Our screen identified five compounds with high potency against adults but low potency or slow-acting microfilaricidal effects, at least one of which acts through a novel mechanism. We show that the use of microfilariae in a primary screen outperforms model nematode developmental assays and virtual screening of protein structures inferred with deep learning. These data provide new leads for drug development, and the high-content and multiplex assays set a new foundation for antifilarial discovery.","Springer Nature","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2023-01-13T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Communications Biology; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 2399-3642; PII: 4435","10.1038/s42003-023-04435-8","","2025-02-06T05:00:00Z","2424832","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2424832","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2424832","Communications Biology","1","6"

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are established drug targets in human medicine but remain unexploited as anthelmintic substrates despite their important roles in nematode neuromuscular and physiological processes. Bottlenecks in exploring the druggability of parasitic nematode GPCRs include a limited helminth genetic toolkit and difficulties establishing functional heterologous expression. In an effort to address some of these challenges, we profile the function and pharmacology of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the human parasite Brugia malayi, an etiological agent of human lymphatic filariasis. While acetylcholine-gated ion channels are intensely studied as targets of existing anthelmintics, comparatively little is known about metabotropic receptor contributions to parasite cholinergic signaling. Using multivariate phenotypic assays in microfilariae and adults, we show that nicotinic and muscarinic compounds disparately affect parasite fitness traits. We identify a putative G protein-linked acetylcholine receptor of B. malayi (Bma-GAR-3) that is highly expressed across intramammalian life stages and adapt spatial RNA in situ hybridization to map receptor transcripts to critical parasite tissues. Tissue-specific expression of Bma-gar-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans (body wall muscle, sensory neurons, and pharynx) enabled receptor deorphanization and pharmacological profiling in a nematode physiological context. Finally, we developed an image-based feeding assay as a reporter of pharyngeal activity to facilitate GPCR screening in parasitized strains. We expect that these receptor characterization approaches and improved knowledge of GARs as putative drug targets will further advance the study of GPCR biology across medically important nematodes.","American Society for Microbiology","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2023-01-24T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e01188-22","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0066-4804","10.1128/aac.01188-22","","2025-02-06T05:00:00Z","2424834","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2424834","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2424834","Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","1","67"

Here we show the role of a novel Cu-binding protein (Cu-BP) in mammalian transcriptional regulation, specifically on skeletal muscle differentiation using murine primary myoblasts. Utilizing synchrotron X-ray fluorescence-mass spectrometry, we identified murine cysteine-rich intestinal protein 2 (mCrip2) as a key Cu-BP abundant in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions. mCrip2 binds two to four Cu<sup>+</sup> ions with high affinity and presents limited redox potential. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of mCrip2 impaired myogenesis, likely due to Cu accumulation in cells. CUT&RUN and transcriptome analyses revealed its association with gene promoters, including MyoD1 and metallothioneins, suggesting a novel Cu-responsive regulatory role for mCrip2. Our work describes the significance of mCrip2 in skeletal muscle differentiation and metal homeostasis, expanding understanding of the Cu-network in myoblasts. Copper (Cu) is essential for various cellular processes, including respiration and stress response, but imbalances can cause serious health issues. This study reveals a new Cu-binding protein (Cu-BP) involved in muscle development in primary myoblasts. Using unbiased metalloproteomic techniques and high throughput sequencing, we identified mCrip2 as a key Cu-BP found in cell nuclei and cytoplasm. mCrip2 binds up to four Cu<sup>+</sup> ions and has a limited redox potential. Deleting mCrip2 using CRISPR/Cas9 disrupted muscle formation due to Cu accumulation. Further analyses showed that mCrip2 regulates the expression of genes like MyoD1, essential for muscle differentiation, and metallothioneins in response to copper supplementation. This research highlights the importance of mCrip2 in muscle development and metal homeostasis, providing new insights into the Cu-network in cells.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States); Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"ATM signaling modulates cohesin behavior in meiotic prophase and proliferating cells","Yu, Zhouliang; Kim, Hyung Jun; Dernburg, Abby F.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Cell Biology","Cohesins are ancient and ubiquitous regulators of chromosome architecture and function, but their diverse roles and regulation remain poorly understood. During meiosis, chromosomes are reorganized as linear arrays of chromatin loops around a cohesin axis. This unique organization underlies homolog pairing, synapsis, double-stranded break induction, and recombination. We report that axis assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans is promoted by DNA-damage response (DDR) kinases that are activated at meiotic entry, even in the absence of DNA breaks. Downregulation of the cohesin-destabilizing factor WAPL-1 by ATM-1 promotes axis association of cohesins containing the meiotic kleisins COH-3 and COH-4. ECO-1 and PDS-5 also contribute to stabilizing axis-associated meiotic cohesins. Further, our data suggest that cohesin-enriched domains that promote DNA repair in mammalian cells also depend on WAPL inhibition by ATM. Thus, DDR and Wapl seem to play conserved roles in cohesin regulation in meiotic prophase and proliferating cells.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2023-03-06T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Structural & Molecular Biology; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 436-450","","","AC02-05CH11231; R01 GM065591","Journal ID: ISSN 1545-9993; PII: 929","10.1038/s41594-023-00929-5","","2025-04-07T04:00:00Z","2470954","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470954","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470954","Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","4","30"

Despite the profound socioeconomic impacts of hearing disorders and the fundamental biological significance of understanding mechanosensory transduction, the composition, structure and mechanism of the mechanosensory transduction complex have remained poorly characterized. Here we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC-1) mechanosensory transduction complex isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans. The two-fold symmetric complex is composed of two copies each of the pore-forming TMC-1 subunit, the calcium-binding protein CALM-1 and the transmembrane inner ear protein TMIE. CALM-1 makes extensive contacts with the cytoplasmic face of the TMC-1 subunits, whereas the single-pass TMIE subunits reside on the periphery of the complex, poised like the handles of an accordion. A subset of complexes additionally includes a single arrestin-like protein, arrestin domain protein (ARRD-6), bound to a CALM-1 subunit. Single-particle reconstructions and molecular dynamics simulations show how the mechanosensory transduction complex deforms the membrane bilayer and suggest crucial roles for lipid–protein interactions in the mechanism by which mechanical force is transduced to ion channel gating.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, in this study, we studied the roles of DIGEORGE-SYNDROME CRITICAL REGION 14-like (AtDGCR14L) in regulating pre-mRNA splicing and salt stress tolerance. We discovered that Arabidopsis AtDGCR14L is required for maintaining plant salt stress tolerance and the constitutively spliced and active isoforms of important stress- and/or abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes. We also identified the interaction between AtDGCR14L and splicing factor U1-70k, which needs a highly conserved three amino acid (TWG) motif in DGCR14. Different from wild-type AtDGCR14L, the overexpression of TWG-substituted AtDGCR14L mutant did not change salt stress tolerance or pre-mRNA splicing of stress/ABA-responsive genes. Additionally, SWITCH3A (SWI3A) is a core subunit of the SWI/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes. We found that SWI3A, whose splicing depends on AtDGCR14L, actively enhances salt stress tolerance. These results revealed that AtDGCR14L may play an essential role in crosstalk between plant salt-stress response and pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms. We also unveiled the potential role of SWI3A in controlling salt stress tolerance. The TWG motif in the intrinsically disordered region of AtDGCR14L is highly conserved and crucial for DGCR14 functions.","","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2024-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","","","","","BNL--226330-2024-JAAM","SC0012704","","10.1111/tpj.17136","","2025-05-20T22:07:01Z","2478428","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2478428","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2478428","The Plant Journal","6","120"

Mycorrhizal fungi have therefore evolved an arsenal of chemical compounds that are hypothesized to protect the hyphal tissues from being eaten, such as the protease inhibitors mycocypins. The genome of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor has an unusually high number of mycocypin-encoding genes. We have characterized the evolution of this class of proteins, identified those induced by symbiosis with a host plant and characterized the biochemical properties of two upregulated L. bicolor mycocypins. More than half of L. bicolor mycocypin-encoding genes are differentially expressed during symbiosis or fruiting body formation. We show that two L. bicolor mycocypins that are strongly induced during symbiosis are cysteine protease inhibitors and exhibit similar but distinct localization in fungal tissues at different developmental stages and during interaction with a host plant. Moreover, we show that these L. bicolor mycocypins have toxic and feeding deterrent effect on nematodes and collembolans, respectively. Therefore, L. bicolor mycocypins may be part of a mechanism by which this species deters grazing by different members of the soil food web.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Australian Research Council (ARC); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Slovenian Research Agency","","United States","2022-07-11T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Microbiology; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4607-4622","","","AC05-00OR22725; DE150100408; 31003A_173097; P4-0127; P4-0432","Journal ID: ISSN 1462-2912","10.1111/1462-2920.16115","","2025-01-27T05:00:00Z","2423970","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2423970","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2423970","Environmental Microbiology","10","24"

Trivalent arsenic (arsenite, As<sup>III</sup>) is more toxic at lower concentrations than the pentavalent form (arsenate, As<sup>V</sup>). In E. coli, the proteins encoded by the arsRBC operon are the major arsenic detoxification mechanism. Our previous transcriptional analyses indicate broad changes in metal uptake and regulation upon arsenic exposure. Currently, it is not known how arsenic exposure impacts the cellular distribution of other metals. This study examines the metalloproteome of E. coli strains with and without the arsRBC operon in response to sublethal doses of As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>. Size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICPMS) was used to investigate the distribution of five metals (<sup>56</sup>Fe, <sup>24</sup>Mg, <sup>66</sup>Zn, <sup>75</sup>As, and <sup>63</sup>Cu) in proteins and protein complexes under native conditions. Parallel analysis by SEC-UV-Vis spectroscopy monitored the presence of protein cofactors. Together, these data reveal global changes in the metalloproteome, proteome, protein cofactors, and soluble intracellular metal pools in response to arsenic stress in E. coli. This work brings to light one outcome of metal exposure and suggests that metal toxicity on the cellular level arises from direct and indirect effects.","MDPI","","Montana State Univ., Bozeman, MT (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Institutes of Health (NIH); USDOE","","United States","2023-02-02T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Microorganisms; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 382","","","SC0020246; MCB-1714556; P20GM103474; S10OD28650; DESC0020246","Journal ID: ISSN 2076-2607; PII: microorganisms11020382","10.3390/microorganisms11020382","","2025-05-07T04:00:00Z","1923427","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1923427","","Microorganisms","2","11"

A promising chemical screening approach is the measurement of products directly from microbial colonies via optically guided matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Measuring the compounds from microbial colonies bypasses liquid culture with a screen that takes approximately 5 s per sample. We describe a protocol combining a dedicated informatics pipeline and sample preparation method that can prepare up to 3,000 colonies in under 3 h. The screening protocol starts from colonies grown on Petri dishes and then transferred onto MALDI plates via imprinting. The target plate with the colonies is imaged by a flatbed scanner and the colonies are located via custom software. The target plate is coated with MALDI matrix, MALDI-MS analyzes the colony locations, and data analysis enables the determination of colonies with the desired biochemical properties. This workflow screens thousands of colonies per day without requiring additional automation. The wide chemical coverage and the high sensitivity of MALDI-MS enable diverse screening projects such as modifying enzymes and functional genomics surveys of gene activation/inhibition libraries.","Bio-protocol LLC","","Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL (United States); Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institute on Drug Abuse","","United States","2023-11-05T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bio-Protocol; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e4862","","","SC0018420; P30 DA018310","Journal ID: ISSN 2331-8325","10.21769/bioprotoc.4862","","2024-04-09T04:00:00Z","2309737","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2309737","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2309737","Bio-Protocol","21","13"
"Site-specific acetylation of polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase regulates its distinct role in DNA repair pathways","Islam, Azharul; Chakraborty, Anirban; Sarker, Altaf H.; Aryal, Uma K.; Pan, Lang; Sharma, Gulshan; Boldogh, Istvan; Hazra, Tapas","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a DNA end-processing enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities, is involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, including base excision (BER), single-strand break (SSBR), and double-strand break repair (DSBR). However, little is known as to how PNKP functions in such diverse repair processes. Here we report that PNKP is acetylated at K142 (AcK142) by p300 constitutively but at K226 (AcK226) by CBP, only after DSB induction. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using AcK142 or AcK226 PNKP-specific antibodies showed that AcK142-PNKP associates only with BER/SSBR, and AcK226 PNKP with DSBR proteins. Despite the modest effect of acetylation on PNKP’s enzymatic activity in vitro, cells expressing non-acetylable PNKP (K142R or K226R) accumulated DNA damage in transcribed genes. Intriguingly, in striatal neuronal cells of a Huntington's Disease (HD)-based mouse model, K142, but not K226, was acetylated. This is consistent with the reported degradation of CBP, but not p300, in HD cells. Moreover, transcribed genomes of HD cells progressively accumulated DSBs. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the association of Ac-PNKP with the transcribed genes, consistent with PNKP’s role in transcription-coupled repair. Thus, our findings demonstrate that acetylation at two lysine residues, located in different domains of PNKP, regulates its distinct role in BER/SSBR versus DSBR.","Oxford University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2024-01-15T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nucleic Acids Research; Journal Volume: 52; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2416-2433","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0305-1048","10.1093/nar/gkae002","","2025-03-27T04:00:00Z","2470684","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470684","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470684","Nucleic Acids Research","5","52"

Postbiotics present several advantages, including safety, extended shelf life, ease of administration, absence of risk, and patentability, making them more appealing than probiotics alone. This review covers various aspects, starting with an introduction, terminology, classification of postbiotics, and brief mechanisms of action. It emphasizes microbial metabolomics as the initial step in discovering novel postbiotics. Commonly employed techniques such as NMR, GC-MS, and LC-MS are briefly outlined, along with their application principles and limitations in microbial metabolomics. The review also examines existing research where these techniques were used to identify, isolate, and characterize postbiotics derived from different microbial sources. The discovery section concludes by highlighting challenges and future directions to enhance postbiotic discovery. In the second half of the review, we delve deeper into numerous published postbiotic clinical trials to date. We provide brief overviews of system-specific trial applications, their objectives, the postbiotics tested, and their outcomes. The review concludes by highlighting ongoing applications of postbiotics in extended clinical trials, offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape in this evolving field.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)","USDOE Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program; USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)","","United States","2024-09-17T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Foods; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 18","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2937","","LA-UR-24-29093; LA-UR-24-32957","89233218CNA000001","Journal ID: ISSN 2304-8158","10.3390/foods13182937","","2025-04-21T04:00:00Z","2446971","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2446971","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2446971","Foods","18","13"

"Dinickel enzyme evolved to metabolize the pharmaceutical metformin and its implications for wastewater and human microbiomes","Tassoulas, Lambros J.; Rankin, Joel A.; Elias, Mikael H.; Wackett, Lawrence P.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; science & technology; metformin; biodegradation; human gut microbiome; metallohydrolase; nickel; biological sciences; biochemistry","Metformin is the first-line treatment for type II diabetes patients and a pervasive pollutant with more than 180 million kg ingested globally and entering wastewater. The drug’s direct mode of action is currently unknown but is linked to effects on gut microbiomes and may involve specific gut microbial reactions to the drug. In wastewater treatment plants, metformin is known to be transformed by microbes to guanylurea, although genes encoding this metabolism had not been elucidated. In the present study, we revealed the function of two genes responsible for metformin decomposition (mfmA and mfmB) found in isolated bacteria from activated sludge. MfmA and MfmB form an active heterocomplex (MfmAB) and are members of the ureohydrolase protein superfamily with binuclear metal-dependent activity. MfmAB is nickel-dependent and catalyzes the hydrolysis of metformin to dimethylamine and guanylurea with a catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of 9.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and KM for metformin of 0.82 mM. MfmAB shows preferential activity for metformin, being able to discriminate other close substrates by several orders of magnitude. Crystal structures of MfmAB show coordination of binuclear nickel bound in the active site of the MfmA subunit but not MfmB subunits, indicating that MfmA is the active site for the MfmAB complex. Mutagenesis of residues conserved in the MfmA active site revealed those critical to metformin hydrolase activity and its small substrate binding pocket allowed for modeling of bound metformin. In conclusion, this study characterizes the products of the mfmAB genes identified in wastewater treatment plants on three continents, suggesting that metformin hydrolase is widespread globally in wastewater.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

To better protect Earth and its biosphere from potential extraterrestrial sources of contamination, as set forth in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, international efforts to develop planetary protection measures strive to understand the danger of cross-contamination processes in Mars sample return missions. We aim to better understand the impact of the martian surface on microbial dormancy and survivability. Radiation resistance of microbes is a key parameter in considering survivability of microbes over geologic times on the frigid, arid surface of Mars that is bombarded by solar and galactic cosmic radiation. We tested the influence of desiccation and freezing on the ionizing radiation survival of six model microorganisms: vegetative cells of two bacteria (Deinococcus radiodurans, Escherichia coli) and a strain of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and vegetative cells and endospores of three Bacillus bacteria (B. subtilis, B. megaterium, B. thuringiensis). Desiccation and freezing greatly increased radiation survival of vegetative polyploid microorganisms when applied separately, and when combined, desiccation and freezing increased radiation survival even more so. Thus, the radiation survival threshold of polyploid D. radiodurans cells can be extended from the already high value of 25 kGy in liquid culture to an astonishing 140 kGy when the cells are both desiccated and frozen. However, such synergistic radioprotective effects of desiccation and freezing were not observed in monogenomic or digenomic Bacillus cells and endospores, which are generally sterilized by 12 kGy. This difference is associated with a critical requirement for survivability under radiation, that is, repair of genome damage caused by radiation. Deinococcus radiodurans and S. cerevisiae accumulate similarly high levels of the Mn antioxidants that are required for extreme radiation resistance, as do endospores, though they greatly exceed spores in radioresistance because they contain multiple identical genome copies, which in D. radiodurans are joined by persistent Holliday junctions. We estimate ionizing radiation survival limits of polyploid DNA-based life-forms to be hundreds of millions of years of background radiation while buried in the martian subsurface. Our findings imply that forward contamination of Mars will essentially be permanent, and backward contamination is a possibility if life ever existed on Mars.","Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-10-31T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrobiology; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1337-1350","","","AC52-07NA27344","Journal ID: ISSN 1531-1074","10.1089/ast.2022.0065","","2025-01-31T05:00:00Z","2424275","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2424275","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2424275","Astrobiology","11","22"

In this approach, a set of parent species is dissociated simultaneously and measured in a single spectrum (in the same manner that a single parent ion is conventionally studied), providing a gain in sensitivity and throughput proportional to the number of species that can be simultaneously addressed. In the present work, simulations performed using the Caenorhabditis elegans predicted proteome database show that multiplexed MS/MS data allow the identification of tryptic peptides from mixtures of up to 10 peptides from a single dataset with only 3 y or b fragments per peptide and a mass accuracy of 2.5 to 5 ppm. At this level of database and data complexity, 98% of the 500 peptides considered in the simulation were correctly identified.

These re-coding events affect coding potential, splice-sites, and stability of mature mRNAs. ADAR is an essential gene and studies in mouse, C. elegans, and Drosophila suggest its primary function is to modify adult behavior by altering signaling components in the nervous system. By comparing the sequence of isogenic cDNAs to genomic DNA, we have identified and experimentally verified 27 new targets of Drosophila ADAR. Our analyses lead us to identify new classes of genes whose transcripts are targets of ADAR including components of the actin cytoskeleton, and genes involved in ion homeostasis and signal transduction. Our results indicate that editing in Drosophila increases the diversity of the proteome, and does so in a manner that has direct functional consequences on protein function.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Concentration-response gene expression analysis in zebrafish reveals phenotypically-anchored transcriptional responses to retene","Wilson, Lindsay B.; McClure, Ryan S.; Waters, Katrina M.; Simonich, Michael T.; Tanguay, Robyn L.","Toxin; Zebrafish; Retene; Transcriptomics; network","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and are associated with human disease. Canonically, many PAHs induce toxicity via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. While the interaction between PAHs and the AHR is well-established, understanding which AHR-regulated transcriptional effects directly result in observable phenotypes and which are adaptive or benign is important to better understand PAH toxicity. Retene is a frequently detected PAH in environmental sampling and has been associated with AHR2-dependent developmental toxicity in zebrafish, though its mechanism of toxicity has not been fully elucidated. To interrogate transcriptional changes causally associated with retene toxicity, we conducted whole-animal RNA sequencing at 48 h post-fertilization after exposure to eight retene concentrations. We aimed to identify the most sensitive transcriptomic responses and to determine whether this approach could uncover gene sets uniquely differentially expressed at concentrations which induce a phenotype. We identified a concentration-response relationship for differential gene expression in both number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and magnitude of expression change. Elevated expression of cyp1a at retene concentrations below the threshold for teratogenicity suggested that while cyp1a expression is a sensitive biomarker of AHR activation, it may be too sensitive to serve as a biomarker of teratogenicity. Genes differentially expressed at only non-teratogenic concentrations were enriched for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway disruption while DEGs identified at only teratogenic concentrations were significantly enriched for response to xenobiotic stimulus and reduction-oxidation reaction activity. DEGs which spanned both non-teratogenic and teratogenic concentrations showed similar disrupted biological processes to those unique to teratogenic concentrations, indicating these processes were disrupted at low exposure concentrations. Gene co-expression network analysis identified several gene modules, including those associated with PAHs and AHR2 activation. One, Module 7, was strongly enriched for AHR2-associated genes and contained the strongest responses to retene. Benchmark concentration (BMC) of Module seven genes identified a median BMC of 7.5 µM, nearly the highest retene concentration with no associated teratogenicity, supporting the hypothesis that Module seven genes are largely responsible for retene toxicity.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE; National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2022-08-25T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Toxicology; Journal Volume: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 950503","","PNNL-SA-173226","AC05-76RL01830; P42 ES016465; P30 ES030287; T32 ES07060","Journal ID: ISSN 2673-3080","10.3389/ftox.2022.950503","","2025-03-17T04:00:00Z","2527315","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2527315","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2527315","Frontiers in Toxicology","","4"

TXISS<sub>OMPs</sub> are broadly distributed across proteobacteria, but properties of the cargo proteins they secrete are largely unexplored. We report biophysical, histochemical, and phenotypic evidence that Xenorhabdus nematophila NilC is surface exposed. Biophysical data and structure predictions indicate that NilC is a two-domain protein with a C-terminal, 8-stranded β-barrel. This structure has been noted as a common feature of TXISS effectors and may be important for interactions with the TXISS<sub>OMP</sub>. The NilC N-terminal domain is more enigmatic, but our results indicate it is ordered and forms a β-sheet structure, and bioinformatics suggest structural similarities to carbohydrate-binding proteins. X. nematophila NilC and its presumptive TXISS<sub>OMP</sub> partner NilB are required for colonizing the anterior intestine of Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes: the receptacle of free-living, infective juveniles and the anterior intestinal cecum (AIC) in juveniles and adults. We show that, in adult nematodes, the AIC expresses a Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)-reactive material, indicating the presence of N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid sugars on the AIC surface. A role for this material in colonization is supported by the fact that exogenous addition of WGA can inhibit AIC colonization by X. nematophila. Conversely, the addition of exogenous purified NilC increases the frequency with which X. nematophila is observed at the AIC, demonstrating that abundant extracellular NilC can enhance colonization. NilC may facilitate X. nematophila adherence to the nematode intestinal surface by binding to host glycans, it might support X. nematophila nutrition by cleaving sugars from the host surface, or it might help protect X. nematophila from nematode host immunity. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of wild type X. nematophila compared to those lacking nilB and nilC revealed differences in cell wall and secreted polysaccharide metabolic pathways. Additionally, purified NilC is capable of binding peptidoglycan, suggesting that periplasmic NilC may interact with the bacterial cell wall. Overall, these findings support a model that NilB-regulated surface exposure of NilC mediates interactions between X. nematophila and host surface glycans during colonization. This is a previously unknown function for a TXISS.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2022-04-29T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Microbiology; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 800366","","","AC05-00OR22725; IOS-1353674; T32-GM07215","Journal ID: ISSN 1664-302X","10.3389/fmicb.2022.800366","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1867768","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1867768","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1867768","Frontiers in Microbiology","2","13"

Collagen fibrils are strengthened through the formation of covalent cross-links, which involve complex enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is responsible for catalyzing the oxidative deamination of lysine and hydroxylysine residues, resulting in the production of aldehydes, allysine, and hydroxyallysine. These intermediates undergo spontaneous condensation reactions, leading to the formation of immature cross-links, which are the initial step in the development of mature covalent cross-links. Additionally, non-enzymatic glycation contributes to the formation of abnormal cross-linking in collagen fibrils. During glycation, specific lysine and arginine residues in collagen are modified by reducing sugars, leading to the creation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs). These AGEs have been associated with changes in the mechanical properties of collagen fibers. Interestingly, various studies have reported that plant polyphenols possess amine oxidase-like activity and can act as potent inhibitors of protein glycation. This review article focuses on compiling the literature describing polyphenols with amine oxidase-like activity and antiglycation properties. Specifically, we explore the molecular mechanisms by which specific flavonoids impact or protect the normal collagen cross-linking process. Furthermore, we discuss how these dual activities can be harnessed to generate properly cross-linked collagen molecules, thereby promoting the stabilization of highly organized collagen fibrils.","MDPI","","Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Idaho Falls, ID (United States)","USDOE; FONDACYT","","United States","2023-07-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Molecular Sciences (Online); Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 10985","","","AC07-05ID14517; 1212026","Journal ID: ISSN 1422-0067; PII: ijms241310985","10.3390/ijms241310985","","2025-03-19T04:00:00Z","2470411","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470411","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470411","International Journal of Molecular Sciences (Online)","13","24"

Defects in membrane potential lead to pleiotropic phenotypes, consistent with the central role of membrane energetics in cell physiology. Homologs of the progestin and AdipoQ receptors (PAQRs) are conserved in multiple phyla of Bacteria and Eukarya. In eukaryotes, PAQRs are proposed to modulate membrane fluidity and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. The role of bacterial homologs has not been elucidated. Here, we use Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis to show that bacterial PAQR homologs, which we name “TrhA,” have a role in membrane energetics homeostasis. Using transcriptional fusions, we show that E. coli TrhA (encoded by yqfA) is part of the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis regulon. Fatty acid analyses and physiological assays show that a lack of TrhA in both E. coli and B. subtilis (encoded by yplQ) provokes subtle but consistent changes in membrane fatty acid profiles that do not translate to control of membrane fluidity. Instead, membrane proteomics in E. coli suggested a disrupted energy metabolism and dysregulated membrane energetics in the mutant, though it grew similarly to its parent. These changes translated into a disturbed membrane potential in the mutant relative to its parent under various growth conditions. Similar dysregulation of membrane energetics was observed in a different E. coli strain and in the distantly related B. subtilis. Together, our findings are consistent with a role for TrhA in membrane energetics homeostasis, through a mechanism that remains to be elucidated.","American Society for Microbiology","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-04-19T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Bacteriology; Journal Volume: 204; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 583-21","","","AC05-00OR22725; MCB 1715185; IOS 1855066","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9193","10.1128/jb.00583-21","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1865737","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865737","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865737","Journal of Bacteriology","4","204"

Filaments composed of ESCRT-III subunits constrict membranes of the intercellular bridge midbody to the abscission point. These filaments also bind and recruit cofactors whose activities help execute abscission and/or delay abscission timing in response to mitotic errors via the NoCut/Abscission checkpoint. We previously showed that the ESCRT-III subunit IST1 binds the cysteine protease Calpain-7 (CAPN7) and that CAPN7 is required for both efficient abscission and NoCut checkpoint maintenance. Here, we report biochemical and crystallographic studies showing that the tandem microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains of CAPN7 bind simultaneously to two distinct IST1 MIT interaction motifs. Structure-guided point mutations in either CAPN7 MIT domain disrupted IST1 binding in vitro and in cells, and depletion/rescue experiments showed that the CAPN7-IST1 interaction is required for (1) CAPN7 recruitment to midbodies, (2) efficient abscission, and (3) NoCut checkpoint arrest. CAPN7 proteolytic activity is also required for abscission and checkpoint maintenance. Hence, IST1 recruits CAPN7 to midbodies, where its proteolytic activity is required to regulate and complete abscission.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States).

We developed the PNNL PreProcessor, a standalone and user-friendly software housing various algorithmic implementations to generate new MS-files with enhanced signal quality and in the same instrument format. Different experimental approaches are supported for IM-MS based on Drift-Tube (DT) and Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM), including liquid chromatography (LC) and infusion analyses. The algorithms extend the dynamic range of the detection system, while reducing file sizes for faster and memory-efficient downstream processing. Specifically, multidimensional smoothing improves peak shapes of poorly defined low-abundance signals, and saturation repair reconstructs the intensity profile of high-abundance peaks from various analyte types. Further, other functionalities are data compression and interpolation, IM demultiplexing, noise filtering by low intensity threshold and spike removal, and exporting of acquisition metadata. Several advantages of the tool are illustrated, including an increase of 19.4% in lipid annotations and a two-times faster processing of LC-DT IM-MS data-independent acquisition spectra from a complex lipid extract of a standard human plasma sample.

Novobiocin (NVB) is a first-in-class inhibitor of the Polθ ATPase activity, and it is currently being tested in clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of NVB-mediated Polθ inhibition. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS), biophysical, biochemical, computational and cellular assays, we found NVB is a non-competitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis. NVB sugar group deletion resulted in decreased potency and reduced HX-MS interactions, supporting a specific NVB binding orientation. Collective results revealed that NVB binds to an allosteric site to block DNA binding, both in vitro and in cells. Comparisons of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumors and matched controls implied that POLQ upregulation in tumors stems from its role in replication stress responses to increased cell proliferation: this can now be tested in fifteen tumor types by NVB blocking ssDNA-stimulation of ATPase activity, required for Polθ function at replication forks and DNA damage sites. Structural and functional insights provided in this study suggest a path for developing NVB derivatives with improved potency for Polθ inhibition by targeting ssDNA binding with entropically constrained small molecules.","Oxford University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2023-09-04T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nucleic Acids Research; Journal Volume: 51; Journal Issue: 18","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 9920-9937","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0305-1048","10.1093/nar/gkad727","","2025-03-20T04:00:00Z","2470682","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470682","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470682","Nucleic Acids Research","18","51"

"Mob4 is essential for spermatogenesis in\n <i>Drosophila melanogaster<\/i>","Santos, Inês B.; Wainman, Alan; Garrido-Maraver, Juan; Pires, Vanessa; Riparbelli, Maria Giovanna; Kovács, Levente; Callaini, Giuliano; Glover, David M.; Tavares, Álvaro A.; Jafar-Nejad, ed., H.","","<title>Abstract</title> <p>Gamete formation is essential for sexual reproduction in metazoans. Meiosis in males gives rise to spermatids that must differentiate and individualize into mature sperm. In Drosophila melanogaster, individualization of interconnected spermatids requires the formation of individualization complexes that synchronously move along the sperm bundles. Here, we show that Mob4, a member of the Mps-one binder family, is essential for male fertility but has no detectable role in female fertility. We show that Mob4 is required for proper axonemal structure and its loss leads to male sterility associated with defective spermatid individualization and absence of mature sperm in the seminal vesicles. Transmission electron micrographs of developing spermatids following mob4RNAi revealed expansion of the outer axonemal microtubules such that the 9 doublets no longer remained linked to each other and defective mitochondrial organization. Mob4 is a STRIPAK component, and male fertility is similarly impaired upon depletion of the STRIPAK components, Strip and Cka. Expression of the human Mob4 gene rescues all phenotypes of Drosophila mob4 downregulation, indicating that the gene is evolutionarily and functionally conserved. Together, this suggests that Mob4 contributes to the regulation of the microtubule- and actin-cytoskeleton during spermatogenesis through the conserved STRIPAK complex. Our study advances the understanding of male infertility by uncovering the requirement for Mob4 in sperm individualization.</p>","Oxford University Press","","","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Supply Chain","","United States","2023-06-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Genetics (Online) Journal Volume: 224 Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1943-2631; iyad104","10.1093/genetics/iyad104","","2024-09-20T04:00:00Z","1994421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1994421","","Genetics (Online)","4","224"

Lignin one of the components of secondary cell wall tightly holds the polysaccharides thereby enhancing the recalcitrance and complexity in the biomass. Laccases (LAC) and peroxidases (PRX) are the major phenyl-oxidases playing key functions during the polymerization of monolignols into lignin. Yet, the functions of laccase and peroxidases gene families remained largely unknown. Hence, the objective of this conducted study is to understand the role of specific LAC and PRX in Populus wood formation and to further investigate how the altered Lac and Prx expression affects biomass recalcitrance and plant growth. This study of heterologous expression of Arabidopsis Lac and Prx genes was conducted in poplar to avoid any otherwise occurring co-suppression mechanism during the homologous overexpression of highly expressed native genes. In the pursuit of optimizing lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production, the present study focuses on harnessing the enzymatic potential of Arabidopsis thaliana Laccase2, Laccase4, and Peroxidase52 through heterologous expression. We overexpressed selected Arabidopsis laccase2 (AtLac2), laccase4 (AtLac4), and peroxidase52 (AtPrx52) genes, based on their high transcript expression respective to the differentiating xylem tissues in the stem, in hybrid poplar (cv. 717) expressed under the developing xylem tissue-specific promoter, DX15 characterized the transgenic populus for the investigation of growth phenotypes and recalcitrance efficiency. Bioinformatics analyses conducted on AtLac2 and AtLac4 and AtPrx52, revealed the evolutionary relationship between the laccase gene and peroxidase gene homologs, respectively. Transgenic poplar plant lines overexpressing the AtLac2 gene (AtLac2-OE) showed an increase in plant height without a change in biomass yield as compared to the controls; whereas AtLac4-OE and AtPrx52-OE transgenic lines did not show any such observable growth phenotypes compared to their respective controls. The changes in the levels of lignin content and S/G ratios in the transgenic poplar resulted in a significant increase in the saccharification efficiency as compared to the control plants. Overall, saccharification efficiency was increased by 35–50%, 21–42%, and 8–39% in AtLac2-OE, AtLac4-OE, and AtPrx52-OE transgenic poplar lines, respectively, as compared to their controls. Moreover, the bioengineered plants maintained normal growth and development, underscoring the feasibility of this approach for biomass improvement without compromising overall plant fitness. This study also sheds light on the potential of exploiting regulatory elements of DX15 to drive targeted expression of lignin-modifying enzymes, thereby providing a promising avenue for tailoring biomass for improved biofuel production. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in synthetic biology and plant biotechnology, offering a sustainable solution to address the challenges associated with lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrance.","BioMed Central","","National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO (United States); Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2024-01-13T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 5","","NREL/JA-2800-88719","AC36-08GO28308; 1230803; R31-2009-000-20025-0","Journal ID: ISSN 2731-3654; MainId:89498;UUID:d2700bfe-e485-4e2a-b813-d4c9b2289db4;MainAdminId:71731","10.1186/s13068-023-02452-7","","2024-11-26T05:00:00Z","2283933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2283933","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2283933","Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts","1","17"

Avoiding protein damage accumulation by enhanced turnover should slow down the aging process and extend the lifespan. But, lowering translational efficiency extends rather than shortens the lifespan in C. elegans. We studied turnover of individual proteins in the long-lived daf-2 mutant by combining SILeNCe (stable isotope labeling by nitrogen in Caenorhabditiselegans) and mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, the majority of proteins displayed prolonged half-lives in daf-2, whereas others remained unchanged, signifying that longevity is not supported by high protein turnover. We found that this slowdown was most prominent for translation-related and mitochondrial proteins. Conversely, the high turnover of lysosomal hydrolases and very low turnover of cytoskeletal proteins remained largely unchanged. The slowdown of protein dynamics and decreased abundance of the translational machinery may point to the importance of anabolic attenuation in lifespan extension, as suggested by the hyperfunction theory.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE","","Netherlands","2016-09-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cell Reports Journal Volume: 16 Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: p. 3028-3040","","","AC05-76RL0 1830; AC0576RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 2211-1247; S2211124716310695; PII: S2211124716310695","10.1016/j.celrep.2016.07.088","","2020-11-28T05:00:00Z","1389085","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1389085","","Cell Reports","11","16"

Arginylation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as the arginyl-tRNA transferases (ATE1s), which are conserved across the eukaryotic domain. Despite their conservation and importance, little is known regarding the structure, mechanism, and regulation of ATE1s. In this work, we show that ATE1s bind a previously undiscovered [Fe-S] cluster that is conserved across evolution. We characterize the nature of this [Fe-S] cluster and find that the presence of the [Fe-S] cluster in ATE1 is linked to its arginylation activity, both in vitro and in vivo, and the initiation of the yeast stress response. Importantly, the ATE1 [Fe-S] cluster is oxygen-sensitive, which could be a molecular mechanism of the N-degron pathway to sense oxidative stress. Taken together, our data provide the framework of a cluster-based paradigm of ATE1 regulatory control.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States).

"Identification of bioactive metabolites using activity metabolomics","Rinschen, Markus M.; Ivanisevic, Julijana; Giera, Martin; Siuzdak, Gary","Mechanisms of disease; Metabolic pathways; Metabolism","The metabolome, the collection of small-molecule chemical entities involved in metabolism, has traditionally been studied with the aim of identifying biomarkers in the diagnosis and prediction of disease. However, the value of metabolome analysis (metabolomics) has been redefined from a simple biomarker identification tool to a technology for the discovery of active drivers of biological processes. It is now clear that the metabolome affects cellular physiology through modulation of other ‘omics’ levels, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. In this Review, we focus on recent progress in using metabolomics to understand how the metabolome influences other omics and, by extension, to reveal the active role of metabolites in physiology and disease. Furthermore, this concept of utilizing metabolomics to perform activity screens to identify biologically active metabolites — which we term activity metabolomics — is already having a broad impact on biology.","Nature Portfolio","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Levels of degradation intermediates, i.e., partially degraded proteins, cannot be distinguished from those of intact proteins by global proteomics analysis, which quantify total protein abundance levels. This study aimed to develop a tool for assessing the aspects of degradation regulation via proteolytic processing through a new multiplexed N-terminomics method involving selective isobaric labeling of protein N-termini and immunoaffinity capture of the labeled N-terminal peptides. Our method allows for not only identification or proteolytic cleavage sites, but also highly multiplexed quantification of proteolytic processing. In this paper, we profiled a number of potential cleavage sites by signal peptidase and provided experimental confirmation of predicted cleavage sites of signal peptide. Furthermore, the present method uniquely represents the landscape of proteomic proteolytic processing rate during early embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, revealing the underlying mechanism of stringent decay regulation of zygotically expressed proteins during early stages of embryogenesis.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE; Institute for Basic Science of Korea","","United States","2020-03-20T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Analytical Chemistry; Journal Volume: 92; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4926-4934","","PNNL-SA-149241","AC05-76RL01830; IBS-R008-D1","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-2700","10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05035","","2021-03-22T04:00:00Z","1657214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1657214","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1657214","Analytical Chemistry","7","92"

To understand how cells adapt to such conditions, we isolated two key components of the transcription machinery from fungal species that live in extreme polar environments: the Ess1 prolyl isomerase and its target, the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Polar Ess1 enzymes are conserved and functional in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By contrast, polar CTDs diverge from the consensus (YSPTSPS)<sub>26</sub> and are not fully functional in S. cerevisiae. These CTDs retain the critical Ess1 Ser-Pro target motifs, but substitutions at Y1, T4, and S7 profoundly affected their ability to undergo phase separation in vitro and localize in vivo. We propose that environmentally tuned phase separation by the CTD and other intrinsically disordered regions plays an adaptive role in cold tolerance by concentrating enzymes and substrates to overcome energetic barriers to metabolic activity.","AAAS","","USDOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), Walnut Creek, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2022-09-09T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science Advances; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 36","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. abq3235","","","AC02-05CH11231; 1515076; R01-GM123985-01; R35-GM138097; OPP-0125611; ANT-0739696","Journal ID: ISSN 2375-2548","10.1126/sciadv.abq3235","","2025-04-11T04:00:00Z","2471091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2471091","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2471091","Science Advances","36","8"

Lysosomal degradation is tightly coupled with autophagy that is induced by many longevity paradigms and required for lifespan extension. The lysosome also serves as a hub for signal transduction and regulates longevity via affecting nuclear transcription. One lysosome-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway is mediated by a lysosome-associated fatty acid binding protein LBP-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans. LBP-8 shuttles lysosomal lipids into the nucleus to activate lipid regulated nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80 and consequently promote longevity. However, the structural basis of LBP-8 action remains unclear. Here, we determined the first 1.3 Å high-resolution structure of this life-extending protein LBP-8, which allowed us to identify a structurally conserved nuclear localization signal and amino acids involved in lipid binding. Additionally, we described the range of fatty acids LBP-8 is capable of binding and show that it binds to life-extending ligands in worms such as oleic acid and oleoylethanolamide with high affinity.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

Its function in lineages with high levels, such as early-diverging fungi (EDF), is of particular interest. Here, we investigated the biological significance and evolutionary implications of 6mA in EDF, which exhibit divergent evolutionary patterns in 6mA usage. The analysis of two Mucorales species displaying extreme 6mA usage reveals that species with high 6mA levels show symmetric methylation enriched in highly expressed genes. In contrast, species with low 6mA levels show mostly asymmetric 6mA. Interestingly, transcriptomic regulation throughout development and in response to environmental cues is associated with changes in the 6mA landscape. Furthermore, we identify an EDF-specific methyltransferase, likely originated from endosymbiotic bacteria, as responsible for asymmetric methylation, while an MTA-70 methylation complex performs symmetric methylation. The distinct phenotypes observed in the corresponding mutants reinforced the critical role of both types of 6mA in EDF.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Physical approaches for describing systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium have been increasingly applied to living systems, which often exhibit phenomena not found in those traditionally studied in physics. Spectacular advances in experimentation during the last decade or two, for example, in microscopy, single-cell dynamics, in the reconstruction of subcellular and multicellular systems outside of living organisms, and in high throughput data acquisition, have yielded an unprecedented wealth of data on cell dynamics, genetic regulation, and organismal development. These data have motivated the development and refinement of concepts and tools to dissect the physical mechanisms underlying biological processes. Notably, landscape and flux theory as well as active hydrodynamic gel theory have proven useful in this endeavor. Together with concepts and tools developed in other areas of nonequilibrium physics, significant progress has been made in unraveling the principles underlying efficient energy transport in photosynthesis, cellular regulatory networks, cellular movements and organization, embryonic development and cancer, neural network dynamics, population dynamics and ecology, as well as aging, immune responses, and evolution. In this paper, recent advances in nonequilibrium physics are reviewd and their application to biological systems is surveyed. Many of these results are expected to be important cornerstones as the field continues to build our understanding of life.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (MOST); National Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR); German Research Foundation (DFG); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Bonn (Germany)","","United States","2019-12-20T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Reviews of Modern Physics; Journal Volume: 91; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 045004","","","SC0018420; SC0019185; NSFC-91430217; 2016YFA0203200; 2013YQ170585; N000141622525; NSF-76066; NSF-1808474; NIH-1R01GM124177-01A1","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-6861; RMPHAT","10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045004","","2023-01-23T05:00:00Z","1595084","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1595084","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1595084","Reviews of Modern Physics","4","91"

Mutant alleles in the human gene encoding CRX result in a variety of distinct blinding retinopathies, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Leber congenital amaurosis. Despite the success of using in vitro biochemistry, animal models, and genomics approaches to study this clinically relevant transcription factor over the past 25 years since its initial characterization, there are no high-resolution structures in the published literature for the CRX protein. In this study, we use bioinformatic approaches and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structural analysis to further understand the biochemical complexity of the human CRX homeodomain (CRX-HD). We find that the CRX-HD is a compact, globular monomer in solution that can specifically bind functional cis-regulatory elements encoded upstream of retina-specific genes.

Single gene mutations account for 15%–20% of cases, largely as part of a syndrome, but the majority are nonsyndromic with complex underlying genetics. We hypothesized that the two noncoding genomic regions identified by a GWAS for craniosynostosis contain distal regulatory elements for the risk genes BMPER and BMP2. To identify such regulatory elements, we surveyed conserved noncoding sequences from both risk loci for enhancer activity in transgenic Danio rerio. We identified enhancers from both regions that direct expression to skeletal tissues, consistent with the endogenous expression of bmper and bmp2. For each locus, we also found a skeletal enhancer that also contains a sequence variant associated with craniosynostosis risk. We examined the activity of each enhancer during craniofacial development and found that the BMPER-associated enhancer is active in the restricted region of cartilage closely associated with frontal bone initiation. The same enhancer is active in mouse skeletal tissues, demonstrating evolutionarily conserved activity. Using enhanced yeast one-hybrid assays, we identified transcription factors that bind each enhancer and observed differential binding between alleles, implicating multiple signaling pathways. Our findings help unveil the genetic mechanism of the two craniosynostosis risk loci. More broadly, our combined in vivo approach is applicable to many complex genetic diseases to build a link between association studies and specific genetic mechanisms.</p>","Oxford University Press","","","USDOE","","United Kingdom","2023-10-26T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Human Molecular Genetics Journal Volume: 33 Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: p. 837-849","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0964-6906","10.1093/hmg/ddad182","","2024-05-07T04:00:00Z","2345802","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2345802","","Human Molecular Genetics","10","33"

Cell walls certainly fit this definition as they can undergo subtle or dramatic changes in structure, assume many shapes, and perform many functions. In this review, we cover the evolution of knowledge of the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of the 5 major cell wall polymer types that range from deceptively simple to fiendishly complex. Along the way, we recognize some of the colorful historical figures who shaped cell wall research over the past 100 years. The shapeshifter analogy emerges more clearly as we examine the evolving proposals for how cell walls are constructed to allow growth while remaining strong, the complex signaling involved in maintaining cell wall integrity and defense against disease, and the ways cell walls adapt as they progress from birth, through growth to maturation, and in the end, often function long after cell death. We predict the next century of progress will include deciphering cell type–specific wall polymers; regulation at all levels of polymer production, crosslinks, and architecture; and how walls respond to developmental and environmental signals to drive plant success in diverse environments.","American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Here, we review different current and future model systems for metaproteome analysis. We introduce model systems for clinical and biotechnological research questions including acid mine drainage, anaerobic digesters, and activated sludge, following a short introduction to microbial communities and metaproteomics. Model systems are useful to evaluate the challenges encountered within (but not limited to) metaproteomics, including species complexity and coverage, biomass availability, or reliable protein extraction. Moreover, the implementation of model systems can be considered as a step forward to better understand microbial community responses and ecological functions of single member organisms. In the future, improvements are necessary to fully explore complex environmental systems by metaproteomics.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2016-01-21T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proteomics; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 783-798","","","AC05-00OR22725","Journal ID: ISSN 1615-9853; KP1601030; ERKP781","10.1002/pmic.201500305","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1286990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1286990","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1286990","Proteomics","5","16"
"Valine-glutamine (VQ) motif coding genes are ancient and non-plant-specific with comprehensive expression regulation by various biotic and abiotic stresses","Jiang, Shu-Ye; Sevugan, Mayalagu; Ramachandran, Srinivasan","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacteria; Co-expression; Evolution; Fungi; Nematode; Oryza sativa; VQ motif","Valine-glutamine (VQ) motif containing proteins play important roles in abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. However, little is known about the origin and evolution as well as comprehensive expression regulation of the VQ gene family. In this study, we systematically surveyed this gene family in 50 plant genomes from algae, moss, gymnosperm and angiosperm and explored their presence in other species from animals, bacteria, fungi and viruses. No VQs were detected in all tested algae genomes and all genomes from moss, gymnosperm and angiosperm encode varying numbers of VQs. Interestingly, some of fungi, lower animals and bacteria also encode single to a few VQs. Thus, they are not plant-specific and should be regarded as an ancient family. Their family expansion was mainly due to segmental duplication followed by tandem duplication and mobile elements. Limited contribution of gene conversion was detected to the family evolution. Generally, VQs were very much conserved in their motif coding region and were under purifying selection. However, positive selection was also observed during species divergence. Many VQs were up- or down-regulated by various abiotic / biotic stresses and phytohormones in rice and Arabidopsis. They were also co-expressed with some of other stress-related genes. All of the expression data suggest a comprehensive expression regulation of the VQ gene family. We provide new insights into gene expansion, divergence, evolution and their expression regulation of this VQ family. VQs were detectable not only in plants but also in some of fungi, lower animals and bacteria, suggesting the evolutionary conservation and the ancient origin. Overall, VQs are non-plant-specific and play roles in abiotic / biotic responses or other biological processes through comprehensive expression regulation.","Springer","","USDOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), Berkeley, CA (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF)","","United States","2018-05-09T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Genomics; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 342","","","AC02-05CH11231; NRF-CRP7-2010-02","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2164; PII: 4733","10.1186/s12864-018-4733-7","","2025-01-22T05:00:00Z","1626814","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1626814","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1626814","BMC Genomics","1","19"
"Parallel String Graph Construction and Transitive Reduction for De Novo Genome Assembly","Guidi, Giulia; Selvitopi, Oguz; Ellis, Marquita; Oliker, Leonid; Yelick, Katherine; Buluc, Aydin","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","One of the most computationally intensive tasks in computational biology is de novo genome assembly, the decoding of the sequence of an unknown genome from redundant and erroneous short sequences. A common assembly paradigm identifies overlapping sequences, simplifies their layout, and creates consensus. Despite many algorithms developed in the literature, the efficient assembly of large genomes is still an open problem. In this work, we introduce new distributed-memory parallel algorithms for overlap detection and layout simplification steps of de novo genome assembly, and implement them in the diBELLA 2D pipeline. Our distributed memory algorithms for both overlap detection and layout simplification are based on linear-algebra operations over semirings using 2D distributed sparse matrices. Our layout step consists of performing a transitive reduction from the overlap graph to a string graph. We provide a detailed communication analysis of the main stages of our new algorithms. diBELLA 2D achieves near linear scaling with over 80% parallel efficiency for the human genome, reducing the runtime for overlap detection by 1.2-1.3× for the human genome and 1.5-1.9× for C.elegans compared to the state-of-the-art. Our transitive reduction algorithm outperforms an existing distributed-memory implementation by 10.5-13.3× for the human genome and 18-29× for the C. elegans. Our work paves the way for efficient de novo assembly of large genomes using long reads in distributed memory.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR)","","United States","2021-05-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings - IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS); Conference: 2021 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), Portland, OR (United States), 17-21 May 2021","","Medium: ED; Size: 12 p.","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1530-2075; ark:/13030/qt211747d3","10.1109/ipdps49936.2021.00060","","2023-07-04T04:00:00Z","1818231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1818231","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1818231","Proceedings - IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)","",""

Heterogeneity of nanoparticle uptake by different cells and subcellular compartments represent the greatest obstacles to a full understanding of the entire spectrum of nanomaterials’ effects. In this work, we used flow cytometry to evaluate changes in cell cycle associated with non-targeted nanocomposite uptake by individual cells and cell populations. Analogous single cell and cell population changes in nanocomposite uptake were explored by X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). Very few nanoparticles are visible by optical imaging without labeling, but labeling increases nanoparticle complexity and the risk of modified cellular uptake. XFM can be used to evaluate heterogeneity of nanocomposite uptake by directly imaging the metal atoms present in the metal-oxide nanocomposites under investigation. While XFM mapping has been performed iteratively in 2D with the same sample at different resolutions, this study is the first example of serial tomographic imaging at two different resolutions. A cluster of cells exposed to non-targeted nanocomposites was imaged with a micron-sized beam in 3D. Next, the sample was sectioned for immunohistochemistry as well as a high resolution “zoomed in” X-ray fluorescence (XRF) tomography with 80 nm beam spot size. Multiscale XRF tomography will revolutionize our ability to explore cell-to-cell differences in nanomaterial uptake.","MDPI","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","National Institutes of Health (NIH); Northwestern University; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE","","United States","2021-09-06T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cancers (Basel); Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 17","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 4497","","","AC02-06CH11357; CA107467; EB002100; GM104530; U54 CA151880; U54CA119341; ECCS‐2025633; DMR‐1720139; CA060553","Journal ID: ISSN 2072-6694; 170937","10.3390/cancers13174497","","2022-02-10T05:00:00Z","1819010","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1819010","","Cancers (Basel)","17","13"

The absence of DNA-PKcs from many model organisms has led to the assumption that DNA-PKcs is a vertebrate-specific PIKK. Here, we find that DNA-PKcs is widely distributed in invertebrates, fungi, plants, and protists, and that threonines 2609, 2638, and 2647 of the ABCDE cluster of phosphorylation sites are highly conserved amongst most Eukaryotes. Furthermore, we identify highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs and domains that are characteristic of DNA-PKcs relative to other PIKKs. These include residues in the Forehead domain and a novel motif we have termed YRPD, located in an α helix C-terminal to the ABCDE phosphorylation site loop. Combining sequence with biochemistry plus structural data on human DNA-PKcs unveils conserved sequence and conformational features with functional insights and implications. The defined generally progressive DNA-PKcs sequence diversification uncovers conserved functionality supported by Evolutionary Trace analysis, suggesting that for many organisms both functional sites and evolutionary pressures remain identical due to fundamental cell biology. The mining of cancer genomic data and germline mutations causing human inherited disease reveal that robust DNA-PKcs activity in tumors is detrimental to patient survival, whereas germline mutations compromising function are linked to severe immunodeficiency and neuronal degeneration. We anticipate that these collective results will enable ongoing DNA-PKcs functional analyses with biological and medical implications.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-10-06T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 87-108","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0079-6107; PII: S0079610720300973","10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.09.010","","2025-03-21T04:00:00Z","2470822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2470822","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2470822","Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology","C","163"

However, we show that normalization genes should be chosen on a condition-by-condition basis. We provide a recommendation that at least two reference genes be used per experiment, a list of recommended pairs for the conditions tested here, and a procedure for identifying a suitable set for an experimenter’s unique design.

Independent of drought, enrichment analysis of the total phloem exudate protein profiles from all samples suggests that the protein content of phloem sap is complex, and includes proteins that function in chaperone systems, branched-chain amino acid synthesis, trehalose metabolism, and RNA silencing. We observed 169 proteins whose abundance changed significantly within the phloem sap, either during drought or recovery. Proteins that became significantly more abundant during drought include members of lipid metabolism, chaperone-mediated protein folding, carboxylic acid metabolism, abscisic acid signaling, cytokinin biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. Conversely, proteins involved in lipid signaling, sphingolipid metabolism, cell wall organization, carbohydrate metabolism, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase are decreased during drought.

The most widely used strategy (Naive model) is oversimplified, cleaving all peptide bonds with equal probability to produce fragments of all charges below that of the precursor ion. More accurate models, based on fragmentation simulation, are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly use in database search algorithms. We have created an ordinal-regression-based model called Basophile that takes fragment size and basic residue distribution into account when determining the charge retention during CID/higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) of charged peptides. This model improves the accuracy of predictions by reducing the number of unnecessary fragments that are routinely predicted for highly-charged precursors. Basophile increased the identification rates by 26% (on average) over the Naive model, when analyzing triply-charged precursors from ion trap data. Basophile achieves simplicity and speed by solving the prediction problem with an ordinal regression equation, which can be incorporated into any database search software for shotgun proteomic identification.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

The frameshifts showed unusual plasticity and rapid evolution, and had little influence on translation rates. The proximity of a stop codon to the 3' mRNA end, rather than its occurrence or sequence context, appeared to designate termination. Thus, a ‘stop codon’ is not a sufficient signal for translation termination, and the default function of stop codons in Euplotes is frameshifting, whereas termination is specific to certain mRNA positions and probably requires additional factors.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-11-21T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Structural & Molecular Biology; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: p. 61-68","","PNNL-SA-123907","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 1545-9993; 453040220","10.1038/nsmb.3330","","2017-07-31T04:00:00Z","1372981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1372981","","Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","1","24"

They were adopted by the HGP at a strategy meeting in Bermuda in February of 1996 and implemented in formal policies by early 1998, mandating daily release of HGP-funded DNA sequences into the public domain. The idea of daily sharing, we argue, emanated directly from strategies for large, goal-directed molecular biology projects first tested within the “community” of C. elegans researchers, and were introduced and defended for the HGP by the nematode biologists John Sulston and Robert Waterston. In the C. elegans community, and subsequently in the HGP, daily sharing served the pragmatic goals of quality control and project coordination. Yet in the HGP human genome, we also argue, the Bermuda Principles addressed concerns about gene patents impeding scientific advancement, and were aspirational and flexible in implementation and justification. They endured as an archetype for how rapid data sharing could be realized and rationalized, and permitted adaptation to the needs of various scientific communities. Yet in addition to the support of Sulston and Waterston, their adoption also depended on the clout of administrators at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the UK nonprofit charity the Wellcome Trust, which together funded 90% of the HGP human sequencing effort. The other nations wishing to remain in the HGP consortium had to accommodate to the Bermuda Principles, requiring exceptions from incompatible existing or pending data access policies for publicly funded research in Germany, Japan, and France. We begin this story in 1963, with the biologist Sydney Brenner’s proposal for a nematode research program at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) at the University of Cambridge. We continue through 2003, with the completion of the HGP human reference genome, and conclude with observations about policy and the historiography of molecular biology.","Springer","","Univ. of California, Oakland, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-11-02T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the History of Biology; Journal Volume: 51; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 693-805","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-5010; PII: 9538","10.1007/s10739-018-9538-7","","2023-07-04T04:00:00Z","1817181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1817181","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1817181","Journal of the History of Biology","4","51"

Previous biophysical studies of the E. coli SMR transporter EmrE suggest that it should also be able to perform proton/toxin symport or uniport, leading to toxin susceptibility rather than resistance in vivo. Here we show EmrE does confer susceptibility to several previously uncharacterized small-molecule substrates in E. coli, including harmane. In vitro electrophysiology assays demonstrate that harmane binding triggers uncoupled proton flux through EmrE. Assays in E. coli are consistent with EmrE-mediated dissipation of the transmembrane pH gradient as the mechanism underlying the in vivo phenotype of harmane susceptibility. Furthermore, checkerboard assays show this alternative EmrE transport mode can synergize with some existing antibiotics, such as kanamycin. These results demonstrate that it is possible to not just inhibit multidrug efflux, but to activate alternative transport modes detrimental to bacteria, suggesting a strategy to address antibiotic resistance.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2022-12-10T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 7655","","","SC0018409; P41GM103399; R24GM141526; R01GM095839; R35GM141748","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 35410","10.1038/s41467-022-35410-2","","2024-10-07T04:00:00Z","2420803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2420803","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2420803","Nature Communications","1","13"
"Multiplex quantitative SILAC for analysis of archaeal proteomes: a case study of oxidative stress responses","McMillan, Lana J.; Hwang, Sungmin; Farah, Rawan E.; Koh, Jin; Chen, Sixue; Maupin‐Furlow, Julie A.","","<title>Summary</title> <p> Stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a quantitative proteomic method that can illuminate new pathways used by cells to adapt to different lifestyles and niches. Archaea, while thriving in extreme environments and accounting for ∼20%–40% of the Earth's biomass, have not been analyzed with the full potential of SILAC. Here, we report SILAC for quantitative comparison of archaeal proteomes, using <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> as a model. A double auxotroph was generated that allowed for complete incorporation of <sup>13</sup> C/ <sup>15</sup> N‐lysine and <sup>13</sup> C‐arginine such that each peptide derived from trypsin digestion was labelled. This strain was found amenable to multiplex SILAC by case study of responses to oxidative stress by hypochlorite. A total of 2565 proteins was identified by LC‐MS/MS analysis ( <italic>q</italic> ‐value ≤ 0.01) that accounted for 64% of the theoretical proteome. Of these, 176 proteins were altered at least 1.5‐fold ( <italic>p</italic> ‐value < 0.05) in abundance during hypochlorite stress. Many of the differential proteins were of unknown function. Those of known function included transcription factor homologs related to oxidative stress by 3D‐homology modelling and orthologous group comparisons. Thus, SILAC is found to be an ideal method for quantitative proteomics of archaea that holds promise to unravel gene function. </p>","Wiley-Blackwell","","","USDOE","","United Kingdom","2017-12-29T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Microbiology Journal Volume: 20 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: p. 385-401","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1462-2912","10.1111/1462-2920.14014","","2023-08-23T04:00:00Z","1415146","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1415146","","Environmental Microbiology","1","20"

To survive drying tardigrades rely on intrinsically disordered CAHS proteins, which also function to prevent perturbations induced by drying in vitro and in heterologous systems. CAHS proteins have been shown to form gels both in vitro and in vivo, which has been speculated to be linked to their protective capacity. However, the sequence features and mechanisms underlying gel formation and the necessity of gelation for protection have not been demonstrated. Here we report a mechanism of fibrillization and gelation for CAHS D similar to that of intermediate filament assembly. We show that in vitro, gelation restricts molecular motion, immobilizing and protecting labile material from the harmful effects of drying. In vivo, we observe that CAHS D forms fibrillar networks during osmotic stress. Fibrillar networking of CAHS D improves survival of osmotically shocked cells. We observe two emergent properties associated with fibrillization; (i) prevention of cell volume change and (ii) reduction of metabolic activity during osmotic shock. We find that there is no significant correlation between maintenance of cell volume and survival, while there is a significant correlation between reduced metabolism and survival. Importantly, CAHS D's fibrillar network formation is reversible and metabolic rates return to control levels after CAHS fibers are resolved. This work provides insights into how tardigrades induce reversible biostasis through the self-assembly of labile CAHS gels.","Wiley -- The Protein Society","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); USDOE","","United States","2024-03-19T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Protein Science; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e4941","","","AC02-06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 0961-8368","10.1002/pro.4941","","2025-03-04T05:00:00Z","2326270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2326270","","Protein Science","4","33"

In silico estimates of protein abundances from publicly available protein spectra can provide useful standard abundance values but contain only data from tissue proteomes, and are not coupled to organelle localization data. A new protein abundance score, the normalized protein abundance scale (NPAS), expands on the number of scored proteins and the scoring accuracy of lower-abundance proteins in Arabidopsis. NPAS was combined with subcellular protein localization data, facilitating quantitative estimations of organelle abundance during routine experimental procedures. A suite of targeted proteomics markers for subcellular compartment markers was developed, enabling independent verification of in silico estimates for relative organelle abundance. Estimation of relative organelle abundance was found to be reproducible and consistent over a range of tissues and growth conditions.

Here, we show that Chlamydomonas controls its Cu quota by balancing Cu import and export, which is disrupted in a Zn deficient cell, thus establishing a mechanistic connection between Cu and Zn homeostasis. Transcriptomics, proteomics and elemental profiling revealed that Zn-limited Chlamydomonas cells up-regulate a subset of genes encoding “first responder” proteins involved in sulfur (S) assimilation and consequently accumulate more intracellular S, which is incorporated into L-cysteine, γ-glutamylcysteine, and homocysteine. Most prominently, in the absence of Zn, free L-cysteine is increased ~80-fold, corresponding to ~2.8 × 10<sup>9</sup> molecules/cell. Interestingly, classic S-containing metal binding ligands like glutathione and phytochelatins do not increase. X-ray fluorescence microscopy showed foci of S accumulation in Zn-limited cells that co-localize with Cu, phosphorus and calcium, consistent with Cu-thiol complexes in the acidocalcisome, the site of Cu(I) accumulation. Notably, cells that have been previously starved for Cu do not accumulate S or Cys, causally connecting cysteine synthesis with Cu accumulation. We suggest that cysteine is an <em>in vivo</em> Cu(I) ligand, perhaps ancestral, that buffers cytosolic Cu.","Oxford University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) can identify histone PTMs, whereas intact protein analysis by MS can detect species missed by bottom-up approaches. We used a novel approach of online two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem MS with high-resolution reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), alternating electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) on precursor ions to maximize fragmentation of uniquely modified species. The first online RPLC separation sorted histone families, then RPLC or weak cation exchange hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (WCX-HILIC) separated species heavily clad in PTMs. Tentative identifications were assigned by matching proteoform masses to predicted theoretical masses that were verified with tandem MS. We used this innovative approach for histone-intact protein PTM mapping (HiPTMap) to identify and quantify proteoforms purified from CD8 T cells after in vivo influenza infection. Activation significantly altered PTMs following influenza infection, histone maps changed as T cells migrated to the site of infection, and T cells responding to secondary infections had significantly more transcription enhancing modifications. Thus, HiPTMap identified and quantified proteoforms and determined changes in CD8 T cell histone PTMs over the course of infection.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

We identified differential translation efficiency as a key mechanism regulating genes involved in centrosome organization and N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modification of RNAs. Our high-coverage measurements enabled, to our knowledge, the first analysis of allele-specific ribosome engagement in early development. These led to the discovery of stage-specific differential engagement of zygotic RNAs with ribosomes and reduced translation efficiency of transcripts exhibiting allele-biased expression. By integrating our measurements with proteomics data, we discovered that ribosome occupancy in germinal vesicle-stage oocytes is the predominant determinant of protein abundance in the zygote. The Ribo-ITP approach will enable numerous applications by providing high-coverage and high-resolution ribosome occupancy measurements from ultra-low input samples including single cells.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2023-06-21T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature (London); Journal Volume: 618; Journal Issue: 7967","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1057-1064","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0028-0836; TRN: US2405626","10.1038/s41586-023-06228-9","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","2001409","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2001409","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2001409","Nature (London)","7967","618"

Here, we used a systems biology approach to investigate the global metabolic responses to lignin pathway perturbations in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. We identified the lignin biosynthetic protein families and found that ammonia-lyases (ALs) are among the most abundant proteins in lignifying tissues in grasses. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data support a link between lignin biosynthesis and primary metabolism mediated by the ammonia released from ALs that is recycled for the synthesis of amino acids via glutamine. RNA interference knockdown of lignin genes confirmed that the route of the canonical pathway using shikimate ester intermediates is not essential for lignin formation in Brachypodium, and there is an alternative pathway from Tyr via sinapic acid for the synthesis of syringyl lignin involving yet uncharacterized enzymatic steps. Our findings support a model in which plant ALs play a central role in coordinating the allocation of carbon for lignin synthesis and the nitrogen available for plant growth. Collectively, these data also emphasize the value of integrative multiomic analyses to advance our understanding of plant metabolism.","American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE","","United States","2022-06-07T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The Plant Cell; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3339-3363","","","AC05-00OR22725","Journal ID: ISSN 1040-4651","10.1093/plcell/koac171","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1884361","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1884361","","The Plant Cell","9","34"

In mammals, zinc accumulation and release are required for oocyte maturation and egg activation, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that zinc flux occurs in Drosophila oocytes and activated eggs, and that zinc is required for female fertility. Our synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals zinc as the most abundant transition metal in Drosophila oocytes. Its levels increase during oocyte maturation, accompanied by the appearance of zinc-enriched intracellular granules in the oocyte, which depend on transporters. Subsequently, in egg activation, which mediates the transition from oocyte to embryo, oocyte zinc levels decrease significantly, as does the number of zinc-enriched granules. This pattern of zinc dynamics in Drosophila oocytes follows a similar trajectory to that in mammals, extending the parallels in female gamete processes between Drosophila and mammals and establishing Drosophila as a model for dissecting reproductive roles of zinc.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

Ewa; Chandonia, John-Marc; Biggin, Mark D.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) at an acceptable false discovery rate (FDR) is challenging. Previously we identified several hundred PPIs from affinity purification - mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data for the bacteria Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris. These two interactomes have lower FDRs than any of the nine interactomes proposed previously for bacteria and are more enriched in PPIs validated by other data than the nine earlier interactomes. To more thoroughly determine the accuracy of ours or other interactomes and to discover further PPIs de novo, here we present a quantitative tagless method that employs iTRAQ MS to measure the copurification of endogenous proteins through orthogonal chromatography steps. 5273 fractions from a four-step fractionation of a D. vulgaris protein extract were assayed, resulting in the detection of 1242 proteins. Protein partners from our D. vulgaris and E. coli AP-MS interactomes copurify as frequently as pairs belonging to three benchmark data sets of well-characterized PPIs. In contrast, the protein pairs from the nine other bacterial interactomes copurify two- to 20-fold less often. We also identify 200 high confidence D. vulgaris PPIs based on tagless copurification and colocalization in the genome. These PPIs are as strongly validated by other data as our AP-MS interactomes and overlap with our AP-MS interactome for D.vulgaris within 3% of expectation, once FDRs and false negative rates are taken into account. Finally, we reanalyzed data from two quantitative tagless screens of human cell extracts. We estimate that the novel PPIs reported in these studies have an FDR of at least 85% and find that less than 7% of the novel PPIs identified in each screen overlap. Our results establish that a quantitative tagless method can be used to validate and identify PPIs, but that such data must be analyzed carefully to minimize the FDR.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE","","United States","2016-06-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Molecular and Cellular Proteomics Journal Volume: 15 Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2186-2202","","","AC02–05CH11231; AC05-00OR22725; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1535-9476; S1535947620335659; PII: S1535947620335659","10.1074/mcp.M115.057117","","2024-03-21T04:00:00Z","1766618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1766618","","Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","6","15"

Two environmental <em>Aeromonas</em> strains (CA23 and CU5) were used to transform ferric iron corrosion products (goethite and lepidocrocite) into stable ferrous iron-bearing minerals (vivianite and siderite). A genomic and transcriptomic approach was used to analyze the metabolic traits of these strains and to evaluate their pathogenic potential. Although genes involved in solid-phase iron reduction were identified, key genes present in other environmental iron-reducing species are missing from the genome of CU5. Several pathogenicity factors were identified in the genomes of both strains, but none of these was expressed under iron reduction conditions. Additional <em>in vivo</em> tests showed hemolytic and cytotoxic activities for strain CA23 but not for strain CU5. Both strains were easily inactivated using ethanol and heat. Nonetheless, given a lesser potential for a pathogenic lifestyle, CU5 is the most promising candidate for the development of a bio-based iron conservation method stabilizing iron corrosion. Based on all the results, a prototype treatment was established using archaeological items. On those, the conversion of reactive corrosion products and the formation of a homogenous layer of biogenic iron minerals were achieved. This study shows how naturally occurring microorganisms and their metabolic capabilities can be used to develop bio-inspired solutions to the problem of metal corrosion.","American Society for Microbiology","","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2019-01-23T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied and Environmental Microbiology; Journal Volume: 85; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e02042-18","","","89233218CNA000001; PZ00P2_142514; PP00P2 163653/1","Journal ID: ISSN 0099-2240; PZ00P2_142514; PP00P2_163653/1","10.1128/aem.02042-18","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1626067","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1626067","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1626067","Applied and Environmental Microbiology","3","85"

Piperlongumine (PL) was recently identified as a novel senolytic agent. However, its mechanism of action and molecular targets in SCs was unknown and thus was investigated. Specifically, we used a PL-based chemical probe to pull-down PL-binding proteins from live cells and then mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify potential molecular targets of PL in SCs. One prominent target was oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1), an important antioxidant protein that regulates the expression of a variety of antioxidant enzymes. We found that OXR1 was upregulated in senescent human WI38 fibroblasts. PL bound to OXR1 directly and induced its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in an SC-specific manner. The knockdown of OXR1 expression by RNA interference significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species in SCs in conjunction with the downregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1, glutathione peroxidase 2, and catalase, but these effects were much less significant when OXR1 was knocked down in non-SCs. More importantly, knocking down OXR1 selectively induced apoptosis in SCs and sensitized the cells to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which SCs are highly resistant to oxidative stress and suggest that OXR1 is a novel senolytic target that can be further exploited for the development of new senolytic agents.","Anatomical Society - Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Institutes of Health (NIH); University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Proteomics Core Facility","","United States","2018-05-15T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Aging Cell; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e12780","","","AC02-05CH11231; P20GM109005; R01CA122023; R01CA219836; R56AG056372; P20GM103429; P20GM121293; S10OD018445","Journal ID: ISSN 1474-9718; ark:/13030/qt3055r19w","10.1111/acel.12780","","2023-06-30T04:00:00Z","1559794","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1559794","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1559794","Aging Cell","4","17"

In large part, this is due to the rapid acceleration in the generation of DNA sequence that occurred as public and private research institutes raced to sequence the human genome. In parallel with the large human genome effort, mostly smaller genomes of other important model organisms were sequenced. Projects following on these initial efforts have made use of technological advances and the DNA sequencing infrastructure that was built for the human and other organism genome projects. As a result, the genome sequences of many organisms are available in high quality draft form. While in many ways this is good news, there are limitations to the biological insights that can be gleaned from DNA sequences alone; genome sequences offer only a bird's eye view of the biological processes endemic to an organism or community. Fortunately, the genome sequences now being produced at such a high rate can serve as the foundation for other global experimental platforms such as proteomics. Proteomic methods offer a snapshot of the proteins present at a point in time for a given biological sample. Current global proteomics methods combine enzymatic digestion, separations, mass spectrometry and database searching for peptide identification. One key aspect of proteomics is the prediction of peptide sequences from mass spectrometry data. Global proteomic analysis uses computational matching of experimental mass spectra with predicted spectra based on databases of gene models that are often generated computationally. Thus, the quality of gene models predicted from a genome sequence is crucial in the generation of high quality peptide identifications. Once peptides are identified they can be assigned to their parent protein. Proteins identified as expressed in a given experiment are most useful when compared to other expressed proteins in a larger biological context or biochemical pathway. In this chapter we will discuss the automatic annotation and the generation of high quality gene models, the setup and execution of global proteomics experiments that are quantitative and statistically rigorous and finally add biological context to proteomics.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, exogenous feeding of chemically synthesized ncAAs at high concentrations is required to compensate for the inefficient cellular uptake and incorporation of these components into proteins, especially in the case of eukaryotic cells and multicellular organisms. To generate organisms capable of autonomously biosynthesizing an ncAA and incorporating it into proteins, we have engineered a metabolic pathway for the synthesis of <italic>O</italic> ‐methyltyrosine (OMeY). Specifically, we endowed organisms with a marformycins biosynthetic pathway‐derived methyltransferase that efficiently converts tyrosine to OMeY in the presence of the co‐factor <italic>S</italic> ‐adenosylmethionine. The resulting cells can produce and site‐specifically incorporate OMeY into proteins at much higher levels than cells exogenously fed OMeY. To understand the structural basis for the substrate selectivity of the transferase, we solved the X‐ray crystal structures of the ligand‐free and tyrosine‐bound enzymes. Most importantly, we have extended this OMeY biosynthetic system to both mammalian cells and the zebrafish model to enhance the utility of genetic code expansion. The creation of autonomous eukaryotes using a 21st amino acid will make genetic code expansion technology more applicable to multicellular organisms, providing valuable vertebrate models for biological and biomedical research. </p>","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","","USDOE","","United Kingdom","2022-09-28T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Protein Science Journal Volume: 31 Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X","","","DE‐AC02‐06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 0961-8368; e4443","10.1002/pro.4443","","2023-09-29T04:00:00Z","1890007","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890007","","Protein Science","10","31"

This is rapidly changing with the recent examples of single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The rate of change is expected to accelerate owing to emerging technologies that range from micro/nanofluidics to microfabricated interfaces for mass spectrometry to third- and fourth-generation automated DNA sequencers. As described in this review, single cell analysis is the new frontier in Omics, and single cell Omics has the potential to transform systems biology through new discoveries derived from cellular heterogeneity.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The minimal structure for iodotyrosine deiodinase function is defined by an outlier protein from the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana","Sun, Zuodong; Xu, Bing; Spisak, Shaun; Kavran, Jennifer M.; Rokita, Steven E.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; flavoprotein; dehalogenase; halotyrosine; reductase; superfamily; nitroreductase","The nitroreductase superfamily of enzymes encompasses many flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent catalysts promoting a wide range of reactions. All share a common core consisting of an FMN-binding domain, and individual subgroups additionally contain one to three sequence extensions radiating from defined positions within this core to support their unique catalytic properties. To identify the minimum structure required for activity in the iodotyrosine deiodinase subgroup of this superfamily, attention was directed to a representative from the thermophilic organism Thermotoga neapolitana (TnIYD). This representative was selected based on its status as an outlier of the subgroup arising from its deficiency in certain standard motifs evident in all homologues from mesophiles. We found that TnIYD lacked a typical Nterminal sequence and one of its two characteristic sequence extensions, neither of which was found to be necessary for activity. We also show that TnIYD efficiently promotes dehalogenation of iodo-, bromo-, and chlorotyrosine, analogous to related deiodinases (IYDs) from humans and other mesophiles. In addition, 2-iodophenol is a weak substrate for TnIYD as it was for all other IYDs characterized to date. Consistent with enzymes from thermophilic organisms, we observed that TnIYD adopts a compact fold and low surface area compared with IYDs from mesophilic organisms. The insights gained from our investigations on TnIYD demonstrate the advantages of focusing on sequences that diverge from conventional standards to uncover the minimum essentials for activity. We conclude that TnIYD now represents a superior starting structure for future efforts to engineer a stable dehalogenase targeting halophenols of environmental concern.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States).

Aegypti and cross linked to His6-TMOF and purified by Ni affinity chromatography. SDS PAGE identified two protein bands (45 and 61 kDa). The bands were cut digested and analyzed using MS/MS identifying a protein sequence (1306 amino acids) in the genome of Ae. aegypti. The mRNA of the receptor was extracted, the cDNA sequenced and cloned into pTAC-MAT-2. E. coli SbmA− was transformed with the recombinant plasmid and the receptor was expressed in the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. The binding kinetics of TMOF-FITC was then followed showing that the cloned receptor exhibits high affinity to TMOF (KD = 113.7 ± 18 nM ± SEM and Bmax = 28.7 ± 1.8 pmol ± SEM). Incubation of TMOF-FITC with E. coli cells that express the receptor show that the receptor binds TMOF and imports it into the bacterial cells, indicating that in mosquitoes the receptor imports TMOF into the gut epithelial cells. A 3D modeling of the receptor indicates that the receptor has ATP binding sites and TMOF transport into recombinant E. coli cells is inhibited with ATPase inhibitors Na Arsenate and Na Azide.</p>","MDPI AG","","","USDOE","","Switzerland","2021-06-23T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biomolecules Journal Volume: 11 Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 934","","","AC05-06OR23100","Journal ID: ISSN 2218-273X; BIOMHC; PII: biom11070934","10.3390/biom11070934","","2021-06-24T04:00:00Z","1798240","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1798240","","Biomolecules","7","11"

We report two crystal structures of Ric8A, one in the apo form and the other in complex with a tagged C-terminal fragment of Gα. These structures reveal two principal domains of Ric8A: an armadillo-fold core and a flexible C-terminal tail. Additionally, they show that the Gα C-terminus binds to a highly-conserved patch on the concave surface of the Ric8A armadillo-domain, with selectivity determinants residing in the Gα sequence. Biochemical analysis shows that the Ric8A C-terminal tail is critical for its stability and function. A model of the Ric8A/Gα complex derived from crosslinking mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the Ric8A C-terminal tail helps organize the GTP-binding site of Gα. This study lays the groundwork for understanding Ric8A function at the molecular level.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

Identifying the protein sequence features responsible for IDP phase separation is critical for understanding physiological roles and pathological consequences of biomolecular condensation, as well as for harnessing phase separation for applications in bioinspired materials design. To expand our knowledge of sequence determinants of IDP phase separation, we characterized variants of the intrinsically disordered RGG domain from LAF-1, a model protein involved in phase separation and a key component of P granules. Based on a predictive coarse-grained IDP model, we identified a region of the RGG domain that has high contact probability and is highly conserved between species; deletion of this region significantly disrupts phase separation in vitro and in vivo. We determined the effects of charge patterning on phase behavior through sequence shuffling. We designed sequences with significantly increased phase separation propensity by shuffling the wild-type sequence, which contains well-mixed charged residues, to increase charge segregation. This result indicates the natural sequence is under negative selection to moderate this mode of interaction. We measured the contributions of tyrosine and arginine residues to phase separation experimentally through mutagenesis studies and computationally through direct interrogation of different modes of interaction using all-atom simulations. Lastly, we show that despite these sequence perturbations, the RGG-derived condensates remain liquid-like. Together, these studies advance our fundamental understanding of key biophysical principles and sequence features important to phase separation.","National Academy of Sciences","","Univ. of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Our aim was to identify the genes and their proteins that are required for the initial activation of aniline as well as to characterize intermediates of this reaction. Aniline-induced genes were revealed by comparison of the proteomes of D. anilini grown with different substrates (aniline, 4- aminobenzoate, phenol, and benzoate). Most genes encoding proteins that were highly abundant in aniline- or 4-aminobenzoate-grown D. anilini cells but not in phenol- or benzoate-grown cells were located in the putative gene clusters ani (aniline degradation), hcr (4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase) and phe (phenol degradation). Of these putative gene clusters, only the phe gene cluster has been studied previously. Based on the differential proteome analysis, four candidate genes coding for kinase subunits and carboxylase subunits were suspected to be responsible for the initial conversion of aniline to 4-aminobenzoate. These genes were cloned and overproduced in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were obtained in inclusion bodies but could be refolded successfully. Two subunits of phenylphosphoamidate synthase and two carboxylase subunits converted aniline to 4-aminobenzoate with phenylphosphoamidate as intermediate under consumption of ATP. Only when both carboxylase subunits, one from gene cluster ani and the other from gene cluster phe, were combined, phenylphosphoamidate was converted to 4-aminobenzoate in vitro, with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and FMN as co-factors. Thus, aniline is degraded by the anaerobic bacterium D. anilini only by recruiting genes for the enzymatic machinery from different gene clusters. We conclude, that D. anilini carboxylates aniline to 4-aminobenzoate via phenylphosphoamidate as an energy rich intermediate analogous to the degradation of phenol to 4-hydroxybenzoate via phenylphosphate.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

While we have chosen AD as an example, the issues we propose are also highly relevant to other neurodegenerative disorders, such as vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, where even less is known about how various biomarkers interact. Indeed, the availability of rich biomarker data across a range of neurodegenerative disorders would enable more accurate pathology-based classification of such conditions (as opposed to the current predominantly clinical classifications). We further hypothesize that building dynamic network biomarkers and pathway crosstalk reference maps using the combined power of several protein/gene-level knowledge priors could accelerate discovery of disease-specific mechanisms and novel drug targets by enrichment with patient specific genetic information. Application of this methodology to large public AD datasets is needed to test our hypotheses and refine the methods. Subsequent replication in independent datasets and population studies as well as functional validation of mechanisms in laboratory models will be the next steps. Ultimately, it is our hope that such novel methods may yield further insights into both disease mechanisms as well as novel targets for biomarker development and drug discovery.","Frontiers","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

We showed previously that autophosphorylation of WNK1 is inhibited by chloride, raising the possibility that WNKs are activated by osmotic stress. Here we demonstrate that unphosphorylated WNK isoforms 3 and 1 autophosphorylate in response to osmotic pressure in vitro, applied with the crowding agent polyethylene glycol (PEG)400 or osmolyte ethylene glycol (EG), and that this activation is opposed by chloride. Small angle x-ray scattering of WNK3 in the presence and absence of PEG400, static light scattering in EG, and crystallography of WNK1 were used to understand the mechanism. Osmosensing in WNK3 and WNK1 appears to occur through a conformational equilibrium between an inactive, unphosphorylated, chloride-binding dimer and an autophosphorylation-competent monomer. An improved structure of the inactive kinase domain of WNK1, and a comparison with the structure of a monophosphorylated form of WNK1, suggests that large cavities, greater hydration, and specific bound water may participate in the osmosensing mechanism. Our prior work showed that osmolytes have effects on the structure of phosphorylated WNK1, suggestive of multiple stages of osmotic regulation in WNKs.","American Society for Cell Biology","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

Understanding the structural and regulatory mechanisms underlying protein complex formation provides insights into biophysical processes. Furthermore, the principle of protein assembly gives guidelines for new biomimetic materials with potential applications in medicine, energy, and nanotechnology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for investigating protein assembly and interactions across spatial scales (single molecules to cells) and temporal scales (milliseconds to days). It has significantly contributed to understanding nanoscale architectures, inter- and intra-molecular interactions, and regulatory elements that determine protein structures, assemblies, and functions. This review describes recent advancements in elucidating protein assemblies with in situ AFM. We discuss the structures, diffusions, interactions, and assembly dynamics of proteins captured by conventional and high-speed AFM in near-native environments and recent AFM developments in the multimodal high-resolution imaging, bimodal imaging, live cell imaging, and machine-learning-enhanced data analysis. These approaches show the significance of broadening the horizons of AFM and enable unprecedented explorations of protein assembly for biomaterial design and biomedical research.","Wiley","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

A major limitation of PDT is off-target oxidation, which can be lethal for the surrounding cells. In this work, we have shown that a novel class of oligo-p-phenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) exhibit selective binding and fluorescence turn-on in the presence of prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of disease-relevant proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and α-synuclein. Concomitant with fluorescence turn-on, OPE also photosensitizes singlet oxygen under illumination through the generation of a triplet state, pointing to the potential application of OPEs as photosensitizers in PDT. Herein, we investigated the photosensitizing activity of an anionic OPE for the photo-oxidation of Aβ fibrils and compared its efficacy to the well-known but nonselective photosensitizer methylene blue (MB). Our results show that, while MB photo-oxidized both monomeric and fibrillar conformers of Aβ40, OPE oxidized only Aβ40 fibrils, targeting two histidine residues on the fibril surface and a methionine residue located in the fibril core. Oxidized fibrils were shorter and more dispersed but retained the characteristic β-sheet rich fibrillar structure and the ability to seed further fibril growth. Importantly, the oxidized fibrils displayed low toxicity. We have thus discovered a class of novel theranostics for the simultaneous detection and oxidization of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the selectivity of OPE’s photosensitizing activity overcomes the limitation of off-target oxidation of traditional photosensitizers and represents an advancement of PDT as a viable strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC).

We have identified 459 high confidence PPIs from D. vulgaris and 391 from Escherichia coli. Compared to the nine published interactomes, our two networks are smaller; are much less highly connected; have significantly lower false discovery rates; and are much more enriched in protein pairs that are encoded in the same operon, have similar functions, and are reproducibly detected in other physical interaction assays. Lastly, our work establishes more stringent benchmarks for the properties of protein interactomes and suggests that bona fide PPIs much more frequently involve protein partners that are annotated with similar functions or that can be validated in independent assays than earlier studies suggested.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2016-05-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Molecular and Cellular Proteomics; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1539-1555","","","AC05-00OR22725; AC02-05CH11231; AC02–05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1535-9476; KP1601010; ERKP691","10.1074/mcp.M115.054692","","2022-03-29T04:00:00Z","1766619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1766619","","Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","5","15"

This effort was an outgrowth of discussions with oncologists on the need to find the cellular origin of signals in mass spectra of serum samples, which provide biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The ultimate goal would be to collect chemical images of biopsy samples allowing the chemical images of diseased and nondiseased sections of a sample to be compared. The equipment needed to prepare tissue samples have been acquired and built. This equipment includes an cyro-ultramicrotome for preparing thin sections of samples and a coating unit. The coating unit uses an electrospray system to deposit small droplets of a UV-photo absorbing compound on the surface of the tissue samples. Both units are operational. The tissue sample must be coated with the organic compound to enable matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and matrix enhanced secondary ion mass spectrometry (ME-SIMS) measurements with the ChIPMA instrument Initial plans to test the sample preparation using human tissue samples required development of administrative procedures beyond the scope of this LDRD. Hence, it was decided to make two types of measurements: (1) Testing the spatial resolution of ME-SIMS by preparing a substrate coated with a mixture of an organic matrix and a bio standard and etching a defined pattern in the coating using a liquid metal ion beam, and (2) preparing and imaging C. elegans worms. Difficulties arose in sectioning the C. elegans for analysis and funds and time to overcome these difficulties were not available in this project. The facilities are now available for preparing biological samples for analysis with the ChIPMA instrument. Some further investment of time and resources in sample preparation should make this a useful tool for chemical imaging applications.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-12-01T05:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 27 p.","","SAND2008-0077","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200921%%286","10.2172/966248","","2021-08-11T04:00:00Z","966248","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/966248","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/966248","","",""

Eukaryotes are not capable of Q synthesis and rely on salvage of the queuine base (q) as a Q precursor. While many bacteria are capable of Q de novo synthesis, salvage of the prokaryotic Q precursors preQ<sub>0</sub>and preQ<sub>1</sub>also occurs. With the exception of <i>Escherichia coli</i> YhhQ, shown to transport preQ<sub>0</sub>and preQ<sub>1</sub>, the enzymes and transporters involved in Q salvage and recycling have not been well described. In this work, we discovered and characterized 2 Q salvage pathways present in many pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The first, found in the intracellular pathogen <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, uses YhhQ and tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) homologs that have changed substrate specificities to directly salvage q, mimicking the eukaryotic pathway. The second, found in bacteria from the gut flora such as <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, salvages preQ<sub>1</sub>from q through an unprecedented reaction catalyzed by a newly defined subgroup of the radical-SAM enzyme family. The source of q can be external through transport by members of the energy-coupling factor (ECF) family or internal through hydrolysis of Q by a dedicated nucleosidase. This work reinforces the concept that hosts and members of their associated microbiota compete for the salvage of Q precursors micronutrients.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

However, this level of engineering will require a great deal more knowledge about the mechanisms of life than is currently available. In particular, we need to understand the interactome (which proteins interact) as it is situated in the three dimensional geometry of the cell (i.e., a situated interactome), and the regulation/dynamics of these interactions. Methods for optical proteomics have become available that allow the monitoring and even disruption/control of interacting proteins in living cells. Here, a range of these methods is reviewed with respect to their role in elucidating the interactome and the relevant spatial localizations. Development of these technologies and their integration into the core competencies of research organizations can position whole institutions and teams of researchers to lead in both the fundamental science and the engineering applications of cellular biology. That leadership could be particularly important with respect to problems of national urgency centered around security, biofuels, and healthcare.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2008-09-01T04:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 26 p.","","SAND2008-6522","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200904%%196","10.2172/945920","","2021-08-11T04:00:00Z","945920","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/945920","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/945920","","",""

Although structures for classical calpains are known, the structure of CAPN5, a non-classical calpain, remains undetermined. Here we report the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the human CAPN5 protease core (CAPN5-PC). Compared to classical calpains, CAPN5-PC requires high calcium concentrations for maximal activity. Structure-based phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment reveal that CAPN5-PC contains three elongated flexible loops compared to its classical counterparts. The presence of a disease-causing mutation (c.799G>A, p.Gly267Ser) on the unique PC2L2 loop reveals a function in this region for regulating enzymatic activity. This mechanism could be transferred to distant calpains, using synthetic calpain hybrids, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism for fine-tuning calpain function by modifying flexible loops. Further, the open (inactive) conformation of CAPN5-PC provides structural insight into CAPN5-specific residues that can guide inhibitor design.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-01-21T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cell Reports; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 881-892.e5","","","R01EY026682; R01EY024665; R01EY025225; R01EY024698; R21AG050437; P30EY026877; F30EYE027986; T32GM007337; P41GM103393; R01HD084422; DBI-1625906; AC02-76SF00515; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2211-1247; TRN: US2104425","10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.077","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1771824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1771824","","Cell Reports","3","30"

While most plants, fungi and bacteria can synthesize thiamine <em>de novo</em>, the oleaginous yeast, <em>Yarrowia lipolytica</em>, cannot. In this paper, we used proteomics together with physiological characterization to understand key metabolic processes influenced and regulated by thiamine availability and identified the genetic basis of thiamine auxotrophy in <em>Y. lipolytica</em>. Specifically, we found thiamine depletion results in decreased protein abundance of the lipid biosynthesis pathways and energy metabolism (i.e., ATP synthase), attributing to the negligible growth and poor sugar assimilation observed in our study. Using comparative genomics, we identified the missing 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate synthase (THI13) in the <em>de novo</em> thiamine biosynthesis of <em>Y. lipolytica</em>, and discovered an exceptional promoter, P3, that exhibits strong activation or tight repression by low and high thiamine concentrations, respectively. Capitalizing on the strength of our thiamine-regulated promoter (P3) to express the missing gene from <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (scTHI13), we engineered the thiamine-prototrophic <em>Y. lipolytica</em>.

Unfortunately, most cell-signaling work has employed single cell types grown under conditions unrelated to their native context. Recent technical developments have started to provide the tools needed to follow signaling between multiple cell types, but gaps in the information they provide have limited their usefulness in building realistic models of heterocellular signaling. Currently, only targeted assays have the necessary sensitivity, selectivity and spatial resolution to usefully probe heterocellular signaling processes, but these are best used to test specific, mechanistic models. Decades of systems biology research with monocultures has provided a solid foundation for building models of heterocellular signaling, but current models lack a realistic description of regulated proteolysis and the feedback processes triggered within and between cells. Identification and understanding of key regulatory processes in the extracellular environment and of recursive signaling patterns between cells will be essential to building predictive models of heterocellular systems.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The discovery of such trans-kingdom RNA silencing has enabled the development of RNA interference-based approaches for controlling diverse crop pathogens and pests. Although HIGS is a promising strategy, the mechanisms by which these regulatory RNAs translocate from plants to pathogens, and how they induce gene silencing in pathogens, are poorly understood. This lack of understanding has led to large variability in the efficacy of various HIGS treatments. This variability is likely due to multiple factors, such as the ability of the target pathogen or pest to take up and/or process RNA from the host, the specific genes and target sequences selected in the pathogen or pest for silencing, and where, when, and how the dsRNAs or amiRNAs are produced and translocated. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the molecular mechanisms underlying HIGS, identify key unanswered questions, and explore strategies for improving the efficacy and reproducibility of HIGS treatments in the control of crop diseases.","American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)","","Indiana Univ., Bloomington, IN (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF); NovoNordisk Foundation","","United States","2022-06-06T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The Plant Cell; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3183-3199","","","0000248555; IOS-1645745; IOS-1842685","Journal ID: ISSN 1040-4651","10.1093/plcell/koac165","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1884347","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1884347","","The Plant Cell","9","34"

In terms of ATP:NADPH ratio, the amount of ATP generated from the linear electron flow does not meet the demand of the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle. Several different mechanisms to increase ATP availability have evolved, including cyclic electron flow in higher plants and the direct import of mitochondrial-derived ATP in diatoms. By imaging a fluorescent ATP sensor protein expressed in living <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> seedlings, we found that MgATP<sup>2-</sup> concentrations were lower in the stroma of mature chloroplasts than in the cytosol, and exogenous ATP was able to enter chloroplasts isolated from 4- and 5-day-old seedlings, but not chloroplasts isolated from 10- or 20-day-old photosynthetic tissues. This observation is in line with the previous finding that the expression of chloroplast nucleotide transporters (NTTs) in <em>Arabidopsis</em> mesophyll is limited to very young seedlings. Employing a combination of photosynthetic and respiratory inhibitors with compartment-specific imaging of ATP, we corroborate the dependency of stromal ATP production on mitochondrial dissipation of photosynthetic reductant. Our data suggest that, during illumination, the provision and consumption of ATP:NADPH in chloroplasts can be balanced by exporting excess reductants rather than importing ATP from the cytosol.","National Academy of Sciences","","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); Seed Funding Program for Basic Research; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Area of Excellence Scheme; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; German Research Foundation (DFG)","","United States","2018-10-23T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; Journal Volume: 115; Journal Issue: 45","","Medium: ED; Size: p.

Here we report the structural characterization of human hemoglobin (Hb), a 64 kDa oxygen-transporting protein complex, by high resolution native top-down mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization (ESI) and a 15-Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Native MS preserves the non-covalent interactions between the globin subunits, and electron capture dissociation (ECD) produces fragments directly from the intact Hb complex without dissociating the subunits. Using activated ion ECD, we observe the gradual unfolding process of the Hb complex in the gas phase. Without protein ion activation, the native Hb shows very limited ECD fragmentation from the N-termini, suggesting a tightly packed structure of the native complex and therefore low fragmentation efficiency. Precursor ion activation allows steady increase of N-terminal fragment ions, while the C-terminal fragments remain limited (38 c ions and 4 z ions on the α chain; 36 c ions and 2 z ions on the β chain). This ECD fragmentation pattern suggests that upon activation, the Hb complex starts to unfold from the N-termini of both subunits, whereas the C-terminal regions and therefore the potential regions involved in the subunit binding interactions remain intact. ECD-MS of the Hb dimer show similar fragmentation patterns as the Hb tetramer, providing further evidence for the hypothesized unfolding process of the Hb complex in the gas phase. Native top-down ECD-MS allows efficient probing of the Hb complex structure and the subunit binding interactions in the gas phase. Finally, it may provide a fast and effective means to probe the structure of novel protein complexes that are intractable to traditional structural characterization tools.","IM Publications","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2015-06-09T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: European Journal of Mass Spectrometry; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 221-231","","","FC03-02ER63421","Journal ID: ISSN 1469-0667","10.1255/ejms.1340","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1345518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1345518","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1345518","European Journal of Mass Spectrometry","3","21"

Here, we collected samples during a dietary crossover study with diets containing large or small amounts of RS. We determined the impact of RS on the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways in the gut, using a combination of “omics” approaches, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. This multiomics approach captured changes in the abundance of specific bacterial species, proteins, and metabolites after a diet high in resistant starch (HRS), providing key insights into the influence of dietary interventions on the gut microbiome.

Studies in model fungi agree on codon usage bias as an adaptation for fine-tuning gene expression levels; however, such knowledge is lacking for most other fungi. Our comparative genomics analysis of over 450 species supports codon usage and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) as coadapted for translation speed and this is most likely a realization of convergent evolution. Rather than drift, phylogenetic reconstruction inferred adaptive radiation as the best explanation for the variation of interspecific codon usage bias. Although the phylogenetic signals for individual codon and tRNAs frequencies are lower than expected by genetic drift, we found remarkable conservation of highly expressed genes being codon optimized for translation by the most abundant tRNAs, especially by inosine-modified tRNAs. As an application, we present a sequence-to-expression neural network that uses codons to reliably predict highly expressed transcripts.

It is visualized as an electron-dense object by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or described with mass spectrometry (MS)–based imaging techniques or multimodal X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) based on its unique elemental composition. Compared with MS-based imaging techniques, XFM offers the additional advantage of absolute quantification of trace metal content, since sectioning of the cell is not required and metabolic states can be preserved rapidly by either vitrification or chemical fixation. In this work, we employed XFM in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to determine single-cell and organelle trace metal quotas within algal cells in situations of trace metal overaccumulation (Fe and Cu). We found up to 70% of the cellular Cu and 80% of Fe sequestered in acidocalcisomes in these conditions and identified two distinct populations of acidocalcisomes, defined by their unique trace elemental makeup. We utilized the vtc1 mutant, defective in polyphosphate synthesis and failing to accumulate Ca, to show that Fe sequestration is not dependent on either. Finally, quantitation of the Fe and Cu contents of individual cells and compartments via XFM, over a range of cellular metal quotas created by nutritional and genetic perturbations, indicated excellent correlation with bulk data from corresponding cell cultures, establishing a framework to distinguish the nutritional status of single cells.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

"Linking crop traits to transcriptome differences in a progeny population of tetraploid potato","Alexandersson, Erik; Kushwaha, Sandeep; Subedi, Aastha; Weighill, Deborah A.; Climer, Sharlee; Jacobson, Daniel A.; Andreasson, Erik","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Background: Potato is the third most consumed crop in the world. Breeding for traits such as yield, product quality and pathogen resistance are main priorities. Identifying molecular signatures of these and other important traits is important in future breeding efforts. In this study, a progeny population from a cross between a breeding line, SW93–1015, and a cultivar, Désirée, was studied by trait analysis and RNA-seq in order to develop understanding of segregating traits at the molecular level and identify transcripts with expressional correlation to these traits. Transcript markers with predictive value for field performance applicable under controlled environments would be of great value for plant breeding.Results: A total of 34 progeny lines from SW93–1015 and Désirée were phenotyped for 17 different traits in a field in Nordic climate conditions and controlled climate settings. A master transcriptome was constructed with all 34 progeny lines and the parents through a de novo assembly of RNA-seq reads. Gene expression data obtained in a controlled environment from the 34 lines was correlated to traits by different similarity indices, including Pearson and Spearman, as well as DUO, which calculates the co-occurrence between high and low values for gene expression and trait. Our study linked transcripts to traits such as yield, growth rate, high laying tubers, late and tuber blight, tuber greening and early flowering. We found several transcripts associated to late blight resistance and transcripts encoding receptors were associated to Dickeya solani susceptibility. Transcript levels of a UBX-domain protein was negatively associated to yield and a GLABRA2 expression modulator was negatively associated to growth rate.Conclusion: In our study, we identify 100’s of transcripts, putatively linked based on expression with 17 traits of potato, representing both well-known and novel associations. This approach can be used to link the transcriptome to traits. We explore the possibility of associating the level of transcript expression from controlled, optimal environments to traits in a progeny population with different methods introducing the application of DUO for the first time on transcriptome data. We verify the expression pattern for five of the putative transcript markers in another progeny population.","BioMed Central","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Swedish Foundation for Environmental Strategic research (Mistra Biotech); Swedish Research Council Formas; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC)","","United States","2020-03-18T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Plant Biology; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 120","","","AC05-00OR22725; RF1 AG053303; GM100364","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2229","10.1186/s12870-020-2305-x","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1615993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1615993","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1615993","BMC Plant Biology","1","20"

Thanks to their high specificity, tailocins have been proposed as precision antibacterial agents for therapeutic applications. Compared to tailed phages, with whom they share an evolutionary and morphological relationship, bacterially produced tailocins kill their host upon production but producing strains display resistance to self-intoxication. Though lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to act as a receptor for tailocins, the breadth of factors involved in tailocin sensitivity, and the mechanisms behind resistance to self-intoxication, remain unclear. Here, we employed genome-wide screens in four non-model pseudomonads to identify mutants with altered fitness in the presence of tailocins produced by closely related pseudomonads. Our mutant screens identified O-antigen composition and display as most important in defining sensitivity to our tailocins. In addition, the screens suggest LPS thinning as a mechanism by which resistant strains can become more sensitive to tailocins. Furthermore, we validate many of these novel findings, and extend these observations of tailocin sensitivity to 130 genome-sequenced pseudomonads. This work offers insights into tailocin–bacteria interactions, informing the potential use of tailocins in microbiome manipulation and antibacterial therapy.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences","","United States","2021-03-01T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The ISME Journal; Journal Volume: 15","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2289-2305","","","AC02-05CH11231; S10RR025622; S10RR029668; S10RR027303; OD018174; DGE 1752814","Journal ID: ISSN 1751-7362","10.1038/s41396-021-00921-1","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1773739","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1773739","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1773739","The ISME Journal","","15"

Knockout of <i>Mmp14</i> (KO) in mice results in a dramatic reduction of body size and wasting followed by premature death, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. Since the mammary gland develops after birth and is thus dependent for its functional progression on systemic and local cues, we chose it as an organ model for understanding why KO mice fail to thrive. A global analysis of the mammary glands’ proteome in the wild type (WT) and KO mice provided insight into an unexpected role of MMP14 in maintaining metabolism and homeostasis. We performed mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics to determine the protein signatures of mammary glands from 7 to 11 days old WT and KO mice and found that KO rudiments had a significantly higher level of rate-limiting enzymes involved in catabolic pathways. Glycogen and lipid levels in KO rudiments were reduced, and the circulating levels of triglycerides and glucose were lower. Analysis of the ultrastructure of mammary glands imaged by electron microscopy revealed a significant increase in autophagy signatures in KO mice. Finally, <i>Mmp14</i> silenced mammary epithelial cells displayed enhanced autophagy. Applied to a systemic level, these findings indicate that MMP14 is a crucial regulator of tissue homeostasis.

"A High-Throughput Method for Identifying Novel Genes That Influence Metabolic Pathways Reveals New Iron and Heme Regulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Glanville, David G.; Mullineaux-Sanders, Caroline; Corcoran, Christopher J.; Burger, Brian T.; Imam, Saheed; Donohue, Timothy J.; Ulijasz, Andrew T.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Tn-seq; biosensor; heme; heme biosynthesis; heme transport; infection; iron; metabolism; transposon sequencing; FlowSeq; Met-Seq","Heme is an essential metabolite for most life on earth. Bacterial pathogens almost universally require iron to infect a host, often acquiring this nutrient in the form of heme. The Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is no exception, where heme acquisition and metabolism are known to be crucial for both chronic and acute infections. To unveil unknown genes and pathways that could play a role with heme metabolic flux in this pathogen, we devised an omic-based approach we dubbed “Met-Seq,” for metabolite-coupled transposon sequencing. Met-Seq couples a biosensor with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and massively parallel sequencing, allowing for direct identification of genes associated with metabolic changes. In this work, we first construct and validate a heme biosensor for use with P. aeruginosa and exploit Met-Seq to identify 188 genes that potentially influence intracellular heme levels. Identified genes largely consisted of metabolic pathways not previously associated with heme, including many secreted virulence effectors, as well as 11 predicted small RNAs (sRNAs) and riboswitches whose functions are not currently understood. We verify that five Met-Seq hits affect intracellular heme levels; a predicted extracytoplasmic function (ECF) factor, a phospholipid acquisition system, heme biosynthesis regulator Dnr, and two predicted antibiotic monooxygenase (ABM) domains of unknown function (PA0709 and PA3390). Finally, we demonstrate that PA0709 and PA3390 are novel heme-binding proteins. Our data suggest that Met-Seq could be extrapolated to other biological systems and metabolites for which there is an available biosensor, and provides a new template for further exploration of iron/heme regulation and metabolism in P. aeruginosa and other pathogens.","American Society for Microbiology","","Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institutes of Health (NIH); USDOE","","United States","2021-02-02T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: mSystems; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e00933-20","","","SC0018409; R01AI135060; BER DE-SC0018409","Journal ID: ISSN 2379-5077","10.1128/msystems.00933-20","","2021-04-28T04:00:00Z","1784789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1784789","","mSystems","1","6"

ERK2 E-K reverses a buried charge in the ERK2 common docking (CD) site, a region that binds activators, inhibitors, and substrates. Little is known about the cellular consequences associated with this mutation, other than apparent increases in tumor resistance to pathway inhibitors. ERK2 E-K, like the mutation of the preceding aspartate (ERK2 D321N [D-N]) known as the sevenmaker mutation, causes increased activity in cells and evades inactivation by dual-specificity phosphatases. As opposed to findings in cancer cells, in developmental assays in <em>Drosophila</em>, only ERK2 D-N displays a significant gain of function, revealing mutation-specific phenotypes. The crystal structure of ERK2 D-N is indistinguishable from that of wild-type protein, yet this mutant displays increased thermal stability. In contrast, the crystal structure of ERK2 E-K reveals profound structural changes, including disorder in the CD site and exposure of the activation loop phosphorylation sites, which likely account for the decreased thermal stability of the protein. These contiguous mutations in the CD site of ERK2 are both required for docking interactions but lead to unpredictably different functional outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that the CD site is in an energetically strained configuration, and this helps drive conformational changes at distal sites on ERK2 during docking interactions.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

Nathaniel; Nelson, W. James; Weis, William I.; Nichols, Scott A.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; adherens junction; focal adhesion; epithelium; protein evolution; evolution; Oscarella; Porifera; Sponge; Vinculin","The evolution of cell-adhesion mechanisms in animals facilitated the assembly of organized multicellular tissues. Studies in traditional animal models have revealed two predominant adhesion structures, the adherens junction (AJ) and focal adhesions (FAs), which are involved in the attachment of neighboring cells to each other and to the secreted extracellular matrix (ECM), respectively. The AJ (containing cadherins and catenins) and FAs (comprising integrins, talin, and paxillin) differ in protein composition, but both junctions contain the actin-binding protein vinculin. The near ubiquity of these structures in animals suggests that AJ and FAs evolved early, possibly coincident with multicellularity. However, a challenge to this perspective is that previous studies of sponges—a divergent animal lineage—indicate that their tissues are organized primarily by an alternative, sponge-specific cell-adhesion mechanism called “aggregation factor.” In this study, we examined the structure, biochemical properties, and tissue localization of a vinculin ortholog in the sponge Oscarella pearsei (Op). Our results indicate that Op vinculin localizes to both cell–cell and cell–ECM contacts and has biochemical and structural properties similar to those of vertebrate vinculin. We propose that Op vinculin played a role in cell adhesion and tissue organization in the last common ancestor of sponges and other animals. Furthermore, these findings provide compelling evidence that sponge tissues are indeed organized like epithelia in other animals and support the notion that AJ- and FA-like structures extend to the earliest periods of animal evolution.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-06-07T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Biological Chemistry; Journal Volume: 293; Journal Issue: 30","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11674-11686","","","AC02-76SF00515; R35GM118064; R01GM114462; 15-EXO15_2–0027","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9258","10.1074/jbc.ra117.001325","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1469753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1469753","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1469753","Journal of Biological Chemistry","30","293"
"ER retention is imposed by COPII protein sorting and attenuated by 4-phenylbutyrate","Ma, Wenfu; Goldberg, Elena; Goldberg, Jonathan","60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","Native cargo proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in COPII-coated vesicles, whereas resident and misfolded proteins are substantially excluded from vesicles by a retention mechanism that remains unresolved. We probed the ER retention process using the proteostasis regulator 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), which we show targets COPII protein to reduce the stringency of retention. 4-PBA competes with p24 proteins to bind COPII. When p24 protein uptake is blocked, COPII vesicles package resident proteins and an ER-trapped mutant LDL receptor. We further show that 4-PBA triggers the secretion of a KDEL-tagged luminal resident, implying that a compromised retention mechanism causes saturation of the KDEL retrieval system. The results indicate that stringent ER retention requires the COPII coat machinery to actively sort biosynthetic cargo from diffusible misfolded and resident ER proteins.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center","","United States","2017-06-08T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: eLife; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e26624","","","AC02-06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 2050-084X","10.7554/elife.26624","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1628870","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1628870","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1628870","eLife","","6"

Transcriptomic- and proteomic-based methodologies have been used to investigate mechanisms of virulence employed by B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis, a convenient surrogate; however, analysis of the pathogen and host metabolomes during infection is lacking. Changes in the metabolites produced can be a result of altered gene expression and/or post-transcriptional processes. Thus, metabolomics complements transcriptomics and proteomics by providing a chemical readout of a biological phenotype, which serves as a snapshot of an organism’s physiological state. However, the poor signal from bacterial metabolites in the context of infection poses a challenge in their detection and robust annotation. In this work, we coupled mammalian cell culture-based metabolomics with feature-based molecular networking of mono- and co-cultures to annotate the pathogen’s secondary metabolome during infection of mammalian cells. These methods enabled us to identify several key secondary metabolites produced by B. thailandensis during infection of airway epithelial and macrophage cell lines. Additionally, the use of in silico approaches provided insights into shifts in host biochemical pathways relevant to defense against infection. Using chemical class enrichment analysis, for example, we identified changes in a number of host-derived compounds including immune lipids such as prostaglandins, which were detected exclusively upon pathogen challenge. Taken together, our findings indicate that co-culture of B. thailandensis with mammalian cells alters the metabolome of both pathogen and host and provides a new dimension of information for in-depth analysis of the host–pathogen interactions underlying Burkholderia infection.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

Thanks to their high specificity, tailocins have been proposed as precision antibacterial agents for therapeutic applications. Compared to tailed phages, with whom they share an evolutionary and morphological relationship, bacterially produced tailocins kill their host upon production but producing strains display resistance to self-intoxication. Though lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to act as a receptor for tailocins, the breadth of factors involved in tailocin sensitivity, and the mechanisms behind resistance to self-intoxication, remain unclear. Here, we employed genome-wide screens in four non-model pseudomonads to identify mutants with altered fitness in the presence of tailocins produced by closely related pseudomonads. Our mutant screens identified O-antigen composition and display as most important in defining sensitivity to our tailocins. In addition, the screens suggest LPS thinning as a mechanism by which resistant strains can become more sensitive to tailocins. We validate many of these novel findings, and extend these observations of tailocin sensitivity to 130 genome-sequenced pseudomonads. This work offers insights into tailocin–bacteria interactions, informing the potential use of tailocins in microbiome manipulation and antibacterial therapy.</jats:p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2021-03-01T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The ISME Journal","","Medium: X","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1751-7362; ark:/13030/qt49h1782m","10.1038/s41396-021-00921-1","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1721644","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1721644","","The ISME Journal","",""

Although tau oligomers have been implicated as important neurotoxic species, little is known about how the primary structures of the six human tau isoforms affect tau oligomerization because the oligomers are metastable and difficult to analyze. To address this knowledge gap, here, we analyzed the initial oligomers formed by the six tau isoforms in the absence of posttranslational modifications or other manipulations using dot blots probed by an oligomer-specific antibody, native-PAGE/western blots, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, mass-spectrometry, and ion-mobility spectroscopy. We found that under these conditions, three-repeat (3R) isoforms are more prone than four-repeat (4R) isoforms to form oligomers. In this study, we also tested whether known inhibitors of tau aggregation affect its oligomerization using three small molecules representing different classes of tau aggregation inhibitors, Methylene Blue (MB), the molecular tweezer CLR01, and the all-D peptide TLKIVW, for their ability to inhibit or modulate the oligomerization of the six tau isoforms. Unlike their reported inhibitory effect on tau fibrillation, the inhibitors had little or no effect on the initial oligomerization. Our study provides novel insight into the primary–quaternary structure relationship of human tau and suggests that 3R-tau oligomers may be an important target for future development of compounds targeting pathological tau assemblies.","Wiley","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2021-12-13T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Protein Science; Journal Volume: 31; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 613-627","","","FC02-02ER63421; GM007185; R01GM103479; S10OD01850","Journal ID: ISSN 0961-8368","10.1002/pro.4257","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1976375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1976375","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1976375","Protein Science","3","31"

Many challenges must be addressed before algal biofuels can be accepted as a component of the fossil fuel replacement strategy. One significant challenge is that the cost of algal fuel production must become competitive with existing fuel alternatives. Algal biofuel production presents the opportunity to fine-tune microbial metabolic machinery for an optimal blend of biomass constituents and desired fuel molecules. Genome-scale model-driven algal metabolic design promises to facilitate both goals by directing the utilization of metabolites in the complex, interconnected metabolic networks to optimize production of the compounds of interest. Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model, we developed a systems-level methodology bridging metabolic network reconstruction with annotation and experimental verification of enzyme encoding open reading frames. We reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network for this alga and devised a novel light-modeling approach that enables quantitative growth prediction for a given light source, resolving wavelength and photon flux. We experimentally verified transcripts accounted for in the network and physiologically validated model function through simulation and generation of new experimental growth data, providing high confidence in network contents and predictive applications. The network offers insight into algal metabolism and potential for genetic engineering and efficient light source design, a pioneering resource for studying light-driven metabolism and quantitative systems biology. Our approach to generate a predictive metabolic model integrated with cloned open reading frames, provides a cost-effective platform to generate metabolic engineering resources. While the generated resources are specific to algal systems, the approach that we have developed is not specific to algae and can be readily expanded to other microbial systems as well as higher plants and animals.","","","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2012-01-13T05:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","Final","Medium: ED; Size: 3MB","","3","FG02-07ER64496","TRN: US201208%%859","10.2172/1033125","","2012-12-05T05:00:00Z","1033125","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1033125","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1033125","","",""

Despite the importance of pectic polysaccharides their biosynthesis is poorly understood. Several genes have been implicated in pectin biosynthesis by mutant analysis, but biochemical activity has been shown for very few.We used reverse genetics and biochemical analysis to study members of Glycosyltransferase Family 92 (GT92) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Biochemical analysis gave detailed insight into the properties of GALS1 (Galactan synthase 1) and showed galactan synthase activity of GALS2 and GALS3. All proteins are responsible for adding galactose onto existing galactose residues attached to the rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) backbone. Significant GALS activity was observed with galactopentaose as acceptor but longer acceptors are favored. Overexpression of the GALS proteins in Arabidopsis resulted in accumulation of unbranched β-1,4-galactan. Plants in which all three genes were inactivated had no detectable β-1,4-galactan, and surprisingly these plants exhibited no obvious developmental phenotypes under standard growth conditions. RG-I in the triple mutants retained branching indicating that the initial Gal substitutions on the RG-I backbone are added by enzymes different from GALS.","Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2018-09-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Plant and Cell Physiology; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2624-2636","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-0781; ark:/13030/qt5v02w456","10.1093/pcp/pcy180","","2023-06-28T04:00:00Z","1477373","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1477373","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1477373","Plant and Cell Physiology","12","59"

Van","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Chlorella variabilis NC64A, a unicellular photosynthetic green alga (Trebouxiophyceae), is an intracellular photobiont of Paramecium bursaria and a model system for studying virus/algal interactions. We sequenced its 46-Mb nuclear genome, revealing an expansion of protein families that could have participated in adaptation to symbiosis. NC64A exhibits variations in GC content across its genome that correlate with global expression level, average intron size, and codon usage bias. Although Chlorella species have been assumed to be asexual and nonmotile, the NC64A genome encodes all the known meiosis-specific proteins and a subset of proteins found in flagella. We hypothesize that Chlorella might have retained a flagella-derived structure that could be involved in sexual reproduction. Furthermore, a survey of phytohormone pathways in chlorophyte algae identified algal orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling, suggesting that these functions were established prior to the evolution of land plants. We show that the ability of Chlorella to produce chitinous cell walls likely resulted from the capture of metabolic genes by horizontal gene transfer from algal viruses, prokaryotes, or fungi. Analysis of the NC64A genome substantially advances our understanding of the green lineage evolution, including the genomic interplay with viruses and symbiosis between eukaryotes.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Although CaMnSODc was found to crystallize as a tetramer, there is no indication from the solution properties that the functionality of CaMnSODc in vivo depends upon the formation of the tetrameric structure. To elucidate further the functional significance of MnSOD quaternary structure, wild-type and mutant forms of ScMnSOD (K182R, A183P mutant) and CaMnSODc (K184R, L185P mutant) with the substitutions at dimer interfaces were analyzed with respect to their oligomeric states and resistance to pH, heat, and denaturant. Dimeric CaMnSODc was found to be significantly more subject to thermal or denaturant-induced unfolding than tetrameric ScMnSOD. The residue substitutions at dimer interfaces caused dimeric CaMnSODc but not tetrameric ScMnSOD to dissociate into monomers. We conclude that the tetrameric assembly strongly reinforces the dimer interface, which is critical for MnSOD activity.","Public Library of Science","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Enhanced Cellulose Degradation Using Cellulase-Nanosphere Complexes","Blanchette, Craig; Lacayo, Catherine I.; Fischer, Nicholas O.; Hwang, Mona; Thelen, Michael P.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Science & Technology - Other Topics","Enzyme catalyzed conversion of plant biomass to sugars is an inherently inefficient process, and one of the major factors limiting economical biofuel production. This is due to the physical barrier presented by polymers in plant cell walls, including semi-crystalline cellulose, to soluble enzyme accessibility. In contrast to the enzymes currently used in industry, bacterial cellulosomes organize cellulases and other proteins in a scaffold structure, and are highly efficient in degrading cellulose. To mimic this clustered assembly of enzymes, we conjugated cellulase obtained from Trichoderma viride to polystyrene nanospheres (cellulase:NS) and tested the hydrolytic activity of this complex on cellulose substrates from purified and natural sources. Cellulase:NS and free cellulase were equally active on soluble carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC); however, the complexed enzyme displayed a higher affinity in its action on microcrystalline cellulose. Similarly, we found that the cellulase:NS complex was more efficient in degrading natural cellulose structures in the thickened walls of cultured wood cells. These results suggest that nanoparticle-bound enzymes can improve catalytic efficiency on physically intractable substrates. We discuss the potential for further enhancement of cellulose degradation by physically clustering combinations of different glycosyl hydrolase enzymes, and applications for using cellulase:NS complexes in biofuel production.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Binding of UDP-Xyl triggers the T131-loop/α6 allosteric switch, which converts the hexameric structure of hUGDH into an inactive, horseshoe-shaped complex (E<sup>Ω</sup>). This allosteric transition buries residue A136 in the protein core to produce a subunit interface that favors the E<sup>Ω</sup> structure. Here we use a methionine substitution to prevent the burial of A136 and trap the T131-loop/α6 switch in the active conformation. We show that hUGDH<sub>A136M</sub> does not exhibit substrate cooperativity, which is strong evidence that the methionine substitution prevents the formation of the low-UDP-Glc-affinity E<sup>Ω</sup> state. In addition, the inhibitor affinity of hUGDH<sub>A136M</sub> is reduced 14-fold, which most likely represents the K<sub>i</sub> for competitive inhibition in the absence of the allosteric transition to the higher-affinity E<sup>Ω</sup> state. hUGDH also displays a lag in progress curves, which is caused by a slow, substrate-induced isomerization that activates the enzyme. Stopped-flow analysis shows that hUGDH<sub>A136M</sub> does not exhibit hysteresis, which suggests that the T131-loop/α6 switch is the source of the slow isomerization. This interpretation is supported by the 2.05 Å resolution crystal structure of hUGDH<sub>A136M</sub>, which shows that the A136M substitution has stabilized the active conformation of the T131-loop/α6 allosteric switch. Furthermore, this work shows that the T131-loop/α6 allosteric switch couples allostery and hysteresis in hUGDH.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","National Inst. of Health","","United States","2016-12-14T05:00:00Z","ENGLISH","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biochemistry; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 202-211","","","R01GM114298","Journal ID: ISSN 0006-2960","10.1021/acs.biochem.6b01044","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1346223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1346223","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1346223","Biochemistry","1","56"

As an option to consider, we present the Pfam5000 strategy, which involves selecting the 5000 most important families from the Pfam database as sources for targets. We compare the Pfam5000 strategy to several other proposed strategies that would require similar numbers of targets. These include including complete solution of several small to moderately sized bacterial proteomes, partial coverage of the human proteome, and random selection of approximately 5000 targets from sequenced genomes. We measure the impact that successful implementation of these strategies would have upon structural interpretation of the proteins in Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and 131 complete proteomes (including 10 of eukaryotes) from the Proteome Analysis database at EBI. Solving the structures of proteins from the 5000 largest Pfam families would allow accurate fold assignment for approximately 68 percent of all prokaryotic proteins (covering 59 percent of residues) and 61 percent of eukaryotic proteins (40 percent of residues). More fine-grained coverage which would allow accurate modeling of these proteins would require an order of magnitude more targets. The Pfam5000 strategy may be modified in several ways, for example to focus on larger families, bacterial sequences, or eukaryotic sequences; as long as secondary consideration is given to large families within Pfam, coverage results vary only slightly. In contrast, focusing structural genomics on a single tractable genome would have only a limited impact in structural knowledge of other proteomes: a significant fraction (about 30-40 percent of the proteins, and 40-60 percent of the residues) of each proteome is classified in small families, which may have little overlap with other species of interest. Random selection of targets from one or more genomes is similar to the Pfam5000 strategy in that proteins from larger families are more likely to be chosen, but substantial effort would be spent on small families.","","OSTI as DE00836980","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The correlation between suppressed recombination and degeneration is clear in animal XY systems, but the absence of recombination is confounded with other asymmetries between the X and Y. In contrast, UV sex chromosomes, like those found in bryophytes, experience symmetrical population genetic conditions. Here, we generate nearly gapless female and male chromosome-scale reference genomes of the moss Ceratodon purpureus to test for degeneration in the bryophyte UV sex chromosomes. We show that the moss sex chromosomes evolved over 300 million years ago and expanded via two chromosomal fusions. Although the sex chromosomes exhibit weaker purifying selection than autosomes, we find that suppressed recombination alone is insufficient to drive degeneration. Instead, the U and V sex chromosomes harbor thousands of broadly expressed genes, including numerous key regulators of sexual development across land plants.","AAAS","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF); Emil Aaltonen Foundation; University of Turku; USDOE","","United States","2021-06-30T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science Advances; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 27","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. eabh2488","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2375-2548; ark:/13030/qt62v9f0w0","10.1126/sciadv.abh2488","","2021-09-23T04:00:00Z","1804603","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804603","","Science Advances","27","7"

The multicellular green alga Volvox carteri and its morphologically diverse close relatives (the volvocine algae) are uniquely suited for investigating the evolution of multicellularity and development. We sequenced the 138 Mb genome of V. carteri and compared its {approx}14,500 predicted proteins to those of its unicellular relative, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Despite fundamental differences in organismal complexity and life history, the two species have similar protein-coding potentials, and few species-specific protein-coding gene predictions. Interestingly, volvocine algal-specific proteins are enriched in Volvox, including those associated with an expanded and highly compartmentalized extracellular matrix. Our analysis shows that increases in organismal complexity can be associated with modifications of lineage-specific proteins rather than large-scale invention of protein-coding capacity.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

D.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Neurospora crassa; Neurospora; sucrose; saccharomyces cerevisiae; eukaryota; protein translation; schizosaccharomyces pombe; translation initiation","Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a key regulator of translation initiation, but its in vivo assembly and molecular functions remain unclear. Here we show that eIF3 from Neurospora crassa is structurally and compositionally similar to human eIF3. N. crassa eIF3 forms a stable 12-subunit complex linked genetically and biochemically to the 13<sup>th</sup> subunit, eIF3j, which in humans modulates mRNA start codon selection. Based on N. crassa genetic analysis, most subunits in eIF3 are essential. Subunits that can be deleted (e, h, k and l) map to the right side of the eIF3 complex, suggesting that they may coordinately regulate eIF3 function. Consistent with this model, subunits eIF3k and eIF3l are incorporated into the eIF3 complex as a pair, and their insertion depends on the presence of subunit eIF3h, a key regulator of vertebrate development. Comparisons to other eIF3 complexes suggest that eIF3 assembles around an eIF3a and eIF3c dimer, which may explain the coordinated regulation of human eIF3 levels. Taken together, these results show that Neurospora crassa eIF3 provides a tractable system for probing the structure and function of human-like eIF3 in the context of living cells.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Howard Hughes Medical Institute","","United States","2013-11-08T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e78715","","","AC02-05CH11231; R56-AI095687; R01-GM65050; P50-GM102706","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0078715","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1627650","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627650","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627650","PLoS ONE","11","8"

It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We have examined this issue using a genetic approach in which natural variations were used to perturb both transcript levels and protein levels among inbred strains of mice. We quantified over 5,000 peptides and over 22,000 transcripts in livers of 97 inbred and recombinant inbred strains and focused on the 7,185 most heritable transcripts and 486 most reliable proteins. The transcript levels were quantified by microarray analysis in three replicates and the proteins were quantified by Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry using O(18)-reference-based isotope labeling approach. We show that the levels of transcripts and proteins correlate significantly for only about half of the genes tested, with an average correlation of 0.27, and the correlations of transcripts and proteins varied depending on the cellular location and biological function of the gene. We examined technical and biological factors that could contribute to the modest correlation. For example, differential splicing clearly affects the analyses for certain genes; but, based on deep sequencing, this does not substantially contribute to the overall estimate of the correlation. We also employed genome-wide association analyses to map loci controlling both transcript and protein levels. Surprisingly, little overlap was observed between the protein- and transcript mapped loci. We have typed numerous clinically relevant traits among the strains, including adiposity, lipoprotein levels, and tissue parameters. Using correlation analysis, we found that a low number of clinical trait relationships are preserved between the protein and mRNA gene products and that the majority of such relationships are specific to either the protein levels or transcript levels. Surprisingly, transcript levels were more strongly correlated with clinical traits than protein levels. In light of the widespread use of high-throughput technologies in both clinical and basic research, the results presented have practical as well as basic implications.","Public Library of Science","","Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Genes comprise a major component of the ''parts list'' that is required for building and maintaining of living organisms. Genome DNA sequences reveal the genetic inventory for a rapidly increasing number of species. Defining and interpreting the instruction manual for protein functions, individually and collectively, is the emerging challenge. Defining protein functions is a complex problem because each gene typically encodes several distinct proteins. As a result, the protein inventory includes as many as 100,000 distinct proteins. Protein functions can vary with developmental stage, anatomical location, and environmental context. Like the problem of sequencing the human genome, the multidimensional nature of protein functions in time, space and context constitutes one of the ''big'' problems in biomedical research.

Visualization of intracellular Cu revealed major Cu accumulation sites coincident with electron-dense structures that stained positive for low pH and polyphosphate, suggesting that they are lysosome-related organelles. Nano-secondary ion MS showed colocalization of Ca and Cu, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy was consistent with Cu<sup>+</sup> accumulation in an ordered structure.

Under non‐irradiated conditions, more DSB sites were occupied by factors (MRE11, COM1, and LIG4) than RAD51 paralogues (RAD51B, RAD51C, and XRCC3) in the nucleus of wild‐type; protein loading of COM1 and XRCC3 was increased in the <italic>ku70</italic> mutant. Therefore, quite differently to its role for HR in meiocytes, rice <italic>COM1</italic> specifically acts in an alternative NHEJ pathway in somatic cells, based on the Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1 (MRN) complex and facilitated by PI3K‐like kinases.

While the biorefinery approach for fuels along with the coproduction of high-value compounds with industrial, therapeutic, or nutraceutical applications have the potential to make algal biofuels more economically viable, a number of challenges continue to hamper algal production systems at all levels. One such hurdle includes the metabolic trade-off often observed between the increased yields of desired products, such as triacylglycerols (TAG), and the growth of an organism. Initial genetic engineering strategies to improve lipid productivity in microalgae, which focused on overproducing the enzymes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis or inactivating competing carbon (C) metabolism, have seen some successes albeit at the cost of often greatly reduced biomass. Emergent approaches that aim at modifying the dynamics of entire metabolic pathways by engineering of pertinent transcription factors or signaling networks appear to have successfully achieved a balance between growth and neutral lipid accumulation. However, the biological knowledge of key signaling networks and molecular components linking these two processes is still incomplete in photosynthetic eukaryotes, making it difficult to optimize metabolic engineering strategies for microalgae. Here, we focus on nitrogen (N) starvation of the model green microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to present the current understanding of the nutrient-dependent switch between proliferation and quiescence, and the drastic reprogramming of metabolism that results in the storage of C compounds following N starvation. We discuss the potential components mediating the transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes and the establishment of quiescence in Chlamydomonas, and highlight the importance of signaling pathways such as those governed by the target of rapamycin (TOR) and sucrose nonfermenting-related (SnRK) kinases in the coordination of metabolic status with cellular growth. A better understanding of how the cell division cycle is regulated in response to nutrient scarcity and of the signaling pathways linking cellular growth to energy and lipid homeostasis, is essential to improve the prospects of biofuels and biomass production in microalgae.","BioMed Central","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE","","United States","2019-12-23T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biotechnology for Biofuels; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 292","","","FG02-91ER20021","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-6834; PII: 1635","10.1186/s13068-019-1635-0","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1618772","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1618772","","Biotechnology for Biofuels","1","12"

PlexinD1, a transmembrane receptor that regulates neuronal and cardiovascular development, is a cargo of GIPCs. GIPC-mediated endocytic trafficking regulates PlexinD1 signaling. Here, we unravel the mechanisms of the interactions among PlexinD1, GIPCs and myosin VI by a series of crystal structures of these proteins in apo or bound states. GIPC1 forms a domain-swapped dimer in an autoinhibited conformation that hinders binding of both PlexinD1 and myosin VI. PlexinD1 binding to GIPC1 releases the autoinhibition, promoting its interaction with myosin VI. GIPCs and myosin VI interact through two distinct interfaces and form an open-ended alternating array. Our data support that this alternating array underlies the oligomerization of the GIPC/Myosin VI complexes in solution and cells.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Reprogramming caspase-7 specificity by regio-specific mutations and selection provides alternate solutions for substrate recognition","Hill, Maureen E.; MacPherson, Derek J.; Wu, Peng; Julien, Olivier; Wells, James A.; Hardy, Jeanne A.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; apoptosis; conformational change; cysteine protease; caspase reporter; GFP; selection; flow cytometry; exosite; substrate binding; specificity; directed evolution; protease/protein engineering","The ability to routinely engineer protease specificity can allow us to better understand and modulate their biology for expanded therapeutic and industrial applications. In this paper, we report a new approach based on a caged green fluorescent protein (CA-GFP) reporter that allows for flow-cytometry-based selection in bacteria or other cell types enabling selection of intracellular protease specificity, regardless of the compositional complexity of the protease. Here, we apply this approach to introduce the specificity of caspase-6 into caspase-7, an intracellular cysteine protease important in cellular remodeling and cell death. We found that substitution of substrate-contacting residues from caspase-6 into caspase-7 was ineffective, yielding an inactive enzyme, whereas saturation mutagenesis at these positions and selection by directed evolution produced active caspases. The process produced a number of nonobvious mutations that enabled conversion of the caspase-7 specificity to match caspase-6. The structures of the evolved-specificity caspase-7 (esCasp-7) revealed alternate binding modes for the substrate, including reorganization of an active site loop. Profiling the entire human proteome of esCasp-7 by N-terminomics demonstrated that the global specificity toward natural protein substrates is remarkably similar to that of caspase-6. Because the esCasp-7 maintained the core of caspase-7, we were able to identify a caspase-6 substrate, lamin C, that we predict relies on an exosite for substrate recognition. These reprogrammed proteases may be the first tool built with the express intent of distinguishing exosite dependent or independent substrates. Finally, this approach to specificity reprogramming should also be generalizable across a wide range of proteases.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-03-31T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Chemical Biology; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1603-1612","","","AC02-98CH10886; AC02-06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 1554-8929","10.1021/acschembio.5b00971","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1345036","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1345036","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1345036","ACS Chemical Biology","6","11"

Here we present the genome sequence of a unicellular green alga from the division chlorophyta, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169, which we will hereafter refer to as C-169. This is the first eukaryotic microorganism from a polar environment to have its genome sequenced. Results The 48.8 Mb genome contained in 20 chromosomes exhibits significant synteny conservation with the chromosomes of its relatives Chlorella variabilis and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The order of the genes is highly reshuffled within synteny blocks, suggesting that intra-chromosomal rearrangements were more prevalent than inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Remarkably, Zepp retrotransposons occur in clusters of nested elements with strictly one cluster per chromosome probably residing at the centromere. Several protein families overrepresented in C. subellipsoidae include proteins involved in lipid metabolism, transporters, cellulose synthases and short alcohol dehydrogenases. Conversely, C-169 lacks proteins that exist in all other sequenced chlorophytes, including components of the glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchoring system, pyruvate phosphate dikinase and the photosystem 1 reaction center subunit N (PsaN). Conclusions We suggest that some of these gene losses and gains could have contributed to adaptation to low temperatures. Comparison of these genomic features with the adaptive strategies of psychrophilic microbes suggests that prokaryotes and eukaryotes followed comparable evolutionary routes to adapt to cold environments.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Effects of humic acid on the interactions between zinc oxide nanoparticles and bacterial biofilms","Ouyang, Kai; Yu, Xiao-Ying; Zhu, Yunlin; Gao, Chunhui; Huang, Qiaoyun; Cai, Peng","","The effects of humic acid (HA) on interactions between ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> KT2440 biofilms at different maturity stages were investigated. Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the ATP content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. However, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the ATP content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular poly-meric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn<sup>2+</sup> originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on HA. The combined results from this work suggest that the biofilm maturity stages and environmental constituents (such as humic acid) are important factors to consider when evaluating potential risks of NPs to ecological systems.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-12-01T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Pollution; Journal Volume: 231; Journal Issue: P1","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1104-1111","","PNNL-SA-132084","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0269-7491","10.1016/j.envpol.2017.07.003","","2023-06-27T04:00:00Z","1422333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1422333","","Environmental Pollution","P1","231"

Instead of reviewing a manuscript in secret for the Editor of a journal, each reviewer simply publishes his review (typically of a paper he wishes to recommend) to his SP network subscribers. Once the SP network reviewers complete their review decisions, the authors can invite any journal editor they want to consider these reviews and initial audience size, and make a publication decision. Since all impact assessment, reviews, and revisions are complete, this decision process should be short. I show how the SP network can provide a new way of measuring impact, catalyze the emergence of new subfields, and accelerate discovery in existing fields, by providing each reader a fine-grained filter for high-impact. I present a three phase plan for building a basic SP network, and making it an effective peer review platform that can be used by journals, conferences, users of repositories such as arXiv, and users of search engines such as PubMed. I show how the SP network can greatly improve review and dissemination of research articles in areas that are not well-supported by existing journals. Finally, I illustrate how the SP network concept can work well with existing publication services such as journals, conferences, arXiv, PubMed, and online citation management sites.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2012-01-01T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1","","","FC02-02ER63421","Journal ID: ISSN 1662-5188","10.3389/fncom.2012.00001","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1628197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1628197","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1628197","Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience","","6"

Msp1 is a transmembrane AAA-ATPase, but its role in TA protein clearance is not known. Here, using purified components reconstituted into proteoliposomes, we show that Msp1 is both necessary and sufficient to drive the ATP-dependent extraction of TA proteins from the membrane. A crystal structure of the Msp1 cytosolic region modeled into a ring hexamer suggests that active Msp1 contains a conserved membrane-facing surface adjacent to a central pore.

"AtIRE1C, an unconventional isoform of the UPR master regulator AtIRE1, is functionally associated with AtIRE1B in Arabidopsis gametogenesis","Pu, Yunting; Ruberti, Cristina; Angelos, Evan R.; Brandizzi, Federica","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Plant Sciences; Arabidopsis thaliana; ER stress; gametogenesis; inositol requiring enzyme-1; unfolded protein response","The unfolded protein response (UPR), a highly conserved set of eukaryotic intracellular signaling cascades, controls the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in normal physiological growth and situations causing accumulation of potentially toxic levels of misfolded proteins in the ER, a condition known as ER stress. During evolution, eukaryotic lineages have acquired multiple UPR effectors, which have increased the pliability of cytoprotective responses to physiological and environmental stresses. The ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease IRE1 is a UPR effector that is conserved from yeast to metazoans and plants. IRE1 assumes dispensable roles in growth in yeast but it is essential in mammals and plants. The Arabidopsis genome encodes two isoforms of IRE1, IRE1A and IRE1B, whose protein functional domains are conserved across eukaryotes. Here, we describe the identification of a third Arabidopsis IRE1 isoform, IRE1C. This protein lacks the ER lumenal domain that has been implicated in sensing ER stress in the IRE1 isoforms known to date. Through functional analyses, we demonstrate that IRE1C is not essential in growth and stress responses when deleted from the genome singularly or in combination with an IRE1A knockout allele. However, we found that IRE1C exerts an essential role in gametogenesis when IRE1B is also depleted. Our results identify a novel, plant-specific IRE1 isoform and highlight that at least the control of gametogenesis in Arabidopsis requires an unexpected functional coordination of IRE1C and IRE1B. More broadly, our findings support the existence of a functional form of IRE1 that is required for development despite the remarkable absence of a protein domain that is critical for the function of other known IRE1 isoforms.","Wiley and American Society of Plant Biologists and Society for Experimental Biology","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI (United States).

Mice lacking the complex I subunit, Ndufs4, develop a fatal progressive encephalopathy resembling Leigh syndrome and die at ≈60 d of age. We previously reported that contin-uously breathing normobaric 11% O<sub>2</sub> from an early age prevents neurological disease and dramatically improves survival in these mice. Here, we report three advances. First, we report updated sur-vival curves and organ pathology in Ndufs4 KO mice exposed to hypoxia or hyperoxia. Whereas normoxia-treated KO mice die from neurodegeneration at about 60 d, hypoxia-treated mice eventually die at about 270 d, likely from cardiac disease, and hyperoxia-treated mice die within days from acute pulmonary edema. Second, we report that more conservative hypoxia regimens, such as contin-uous normobaric 17% O<sub>2</sub> or intermittent hypoxia, are ineffective in preventing neuropathology. Finally, we show that breathing normobaric 11% O<sub>2</sub> in mice with late-stage encephalopathy re-verses their established neurological disease, evidenced by im-proved behavior, circulating disease biomarkers, and survival rates. Importantly, the pathognomonic MRI brain lesions and neurohistopathologic findings are reversed after 4 wk of hyp-oxia. Upon return to normoxia, Ndufs4 KO mice die within days. Future work is required to determine if hypoxia can be used to prevent and reverse neurodegeneration in other animal models, and to determine if it can be provided in a safe and practical manner to allow in-hospital human therapeutic trials.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Krell Institute, Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-05-08T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: p.

Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the ATP content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. But, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the ATP content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn<sup>2+</sup> originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on HA. Furthermore, the combined results from this work suggest that the biofilm maturity stages and environmental constituents (such as humic acid) are important factors to consider when evaluating potential risks of NPs to ecological systems.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-08-26T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Pollution; Journal Volume: 231","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1104-1111","","","AC05-76RL01830; 41522106; 2016YFD0800206; 2015CB150504; 90001","Journal ID: ISSN 0269-7491; PII: S0269749117312381","10.1016/j.envpol.2017.07.003","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1390564","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1390564","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1390564","Environmental Pollution","","231"

"Defining the Plant Peroxisomal Proteome: From Arabidopsis to Rice","Kaur, Navneet; Hu, Jianping","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Plant Sciences","Peroxisomes are small subcellular organelles mediating a multitude of processes in plants. Proteomics studies over the last several years have yielded much needed information on the composition of plant peroxisomes. In this review, the status of peroxisome proteomics studies in Arabidopsis and other plant species and the cumulative advances made through these studies are summarized. A reference Arabidopsis peroxisome proteome is generated, and some unique aspects of Arabidopsis peroxisomes that were uncovered through proteomics studies and hint at unanticipated peroxisomal functions are also highlighted. Knowledge gained from Arabidopsis was utilized to compile a tentative list of peroxisome proteins for the model monocot plant, rice. Differences in the peroxisomal proteome between these two model plants were drawn, and novel facets in rice were expounded upon. Finally, we discuss about the current limitations of experimental proteomics in decoding the complete and dynamic makeup of peroxisomes, and complementary and integrated approaches that would be beneficial to defining the peroxisomal metabolic and regulatory roadmaps. The synteny of genomes in the grass family makes rice an ideal model to study peroxisomes in cereal crops, in which these organelles have received much less attention, with the ultimate goal to improve crop yield.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Cellulose microfibrils, which are synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, are the primary load-bearing elements of plant cell walls. Cell walls are dynamic structures that are regulated in part by cell wall integrity (CWI)-monitoring systems that feed back to modulate wall properties and the synthesis of new wall components. Several receptor-like kinases have been implicated as sensors of CWI, including the FEI1/FEI2 receptor-like kinases. Here, we characterize two genes encoding novel plant-specific plasma membrane proteins (SHOU4 and SHOU4L) that were identified in a suppressor screen of the cellulose-deficient fei1 fei2 mutant. shou4 shou4l double mutants display phenotypes consistent with elevated levels of cellulose, and elevated levels of non-crystalline cellulose are present in this mutant. Disruption of SHOU4 and SHOU4L increases the abundance of CESA proteins at the plasma membrane as a result of enhanced exocytosis. In conclusion, the SHOU4/4L N-terminal cytosolic domains directly interact with CESAs. Our results suggest that the SHOU4 proteins regulate cellulose synthesis in plants by influencing the trafficking of CESA complexes to the cell surface.","Elsevier","","University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2018-09-20T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Current Biology; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 19","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3174-3182.e6","","","SC0001090","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-9822; 1456658; 825.13.018","10.1016/j.cub.2018.07.076","","2022-04-01T04:00:00Z","1634833","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1634833","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1634833","Current Biology","19","28"

We demonstrate that TGNap1 is a TGN protein required for the homeostasis of biosynthetic and endocytic traffic pathways. We also show that TGNap1 binds Rab6, YIP4 and microtubules. Finally, we establish that TGNap1 contributes to microtubule-dependent biogenesis, tracking and function of a TGN subset, likely through interaction with Rab6 and YIP4.

We have recently shown that loss-of-function cslf6 rice mutants do not accumulate MLG in most vegetative tissues. Despite the absence of a structurally important polymer, MLG, these mutants are unexpectedly viable and only show a moderate growth compromise compared to wild type. Therefore these mutants are ideal biological systems to test the current grass cell wall model. In order to gain a better understanding of the role of MLG in the primary wall, we performed in-depth compositional and structural analyses of the cell walls of 3 day-old rice seedlings using various biochemical and novel microspectroscopic approaches. We found that cellulose content as well as matrix polysaccharide composition was not significantly altered in the MLG deficient mutant. However, we observed a significant change in cellulose microfibril bundle organization in mesophyll cell walls of the <em>cslf6</em> mutant. Using synchrotron source Fourier Transform Mid-Infrared (FTM-IR) Spectromicroscopy for high-resolution imaging, we determined that the bonds associated with cellulose and arabinoxylan, another major component of the primary cell walls of grasses, were in a lower energy configuration compared to wild type, suggesting a slightly weaker primary wall in MLG deficient mesophyll cells. Finally, taken together, these results suggest that MLG may influence cellulose deposition in mesophyll cell walls without significantly affecting anisotropic growth thus challenging MLG importance in cell wall expansion.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Plant Science; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 628","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1664-462X","10.3389/fpls.2015.00628","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1257262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1257262","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1257262","Frontiers in Plant Science","","6"

We quantitatively analyzed the novelty, cost, and impact of structures solved by SG centers, and contrast these results with traditional structural biology. The first structure from a protein family is particularly important to reveal the fold and ancient relationships to other proteins. In the last year, approximately half of such structures were solved at a SG center rather than in a traditional laboratory. Furthermore, the cost of solving a structure at the most efficient U.S. center has now dropped to one-quarter the estimated cost of solving a structure by traditional methods. However, top structural biology laboratories are much more efficient than the average, and comparable to SG centers despite working on very challenging structures. Moreover, traditional structural biology papers are cited significantly more often, suggesting greater current impact.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Studies in muscle and endothelial cells have reported on the role of myoferlin in membrane repair, endocytosis, myoblast fusion, and the proper expression of various plasma membrane receptors. In this study, using an in vitro human breast cancer cell model, we demonstrate that myoferlin is abundantly expressed in invasive breast tumor cells. Depletion of MYOF using lentiviral-driven shRNA expression revealed that MDA-MB-231 cells reverted to an epithelial morphology, suggesting at least some features of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). These observations were confirmed by the down-regulation of some mesenchymal cell markers (e.g., fibronectin and vimentin) and coordinate up-regulation of the E-cadherin epithelial marker. Cell invasion assays using Boyden chambers showed that loss of MYOF led to a significant diminution in invasion through Matrigel or type I collagen, while cell migration was unaffected. PCR array and screening of serum-free culture supernatants from shRNA<sup>MYOF</sup> transduced MDA-MB-231 cells indicated a significant reduction in the steady-state levels of several matrix metalloproteinases. These data when considered in toto suggest a novel role of MYOF in breast tumor cell invasion and a potential reversion to an epithelial phenotype upon loss of MYOF.","Public Library of Science","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Ohio State University Perinatal Research and Development Fund; National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Science Foundation Nanoscience Science and Engineering Center; Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET)","","United States","2012-06-27T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e39766","","","AC05-76RL01830; K08 HD49628; EEC-0425626; 1134201","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0039766","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1627529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627529","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627529","PLoS ONE","6","7"

It can also be difficult to keep pace with rapidly expanding biological knowledge, which often results in daily changes to any of the over 47,000 gene ontologies that describe biological knowledge. GOATOOLS, a Python-based library, makes it more efficient to stay current with the latest ontologies and annotations, perform gene ontology enrichment analyses to determine over- and under-represented terms, and organize results for greater clarity and easier interpretation using a novel GOATOOLS GO grouping method. We performed functional analyses on both stochastic simulation data and real data from a published RNA-seq study to compare the enrichment results from GOATOOLS to two other popular tools: DAVID and GOstats.

"Understanding the metabolome and metagenome as extended phenotypes: The next frontier in macroalgae domestication and improvement","DeWeese, Kelly J.; Osborne, Melisa G.","","<title>Abstract</title> <p> <bold>“</bold> Omics” techniques (including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics) have been employed with huge success in the improvement of agricultural crops. As marine aquaculture of macroalgae expands globally, biologists are working to domesticate species of macroalgae by applying these techniques tested in agriculture to wild macroalgae species. Metabolomics has revealed metabolites and pathways that influence agriculturally relevant traits in crops, allowing for informed crop crossing schemes and genomic improvement strategies that would be pivotal to inform selection on macroalgae for domestication. Advances in metagenomics have improved understanding of host–symbiont interactions and the potential for microbial organisms to improve crop outcomes. There is much room in the field of macroalgal biology for further research toward improvement of macroalgae cultivars in aquaculture using metabolomic and metagenomic analyses. To this end, this review discusses the application and necessary expansion of the omics tool kit for macroalgae domestication as we move to enhance seaweed farming worldwide. </p>","Wiley-Blackwell","","","USDOE","","United States","2021-03-24T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society Journal Volume: 52 Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1009-1030","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0893-8849","10.1111/jwas.12782","","2023-08-31T04:00:00Z","1772655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1772655","","Journal of the World Aquaculture Society","5","52"

The high-level goal of TMTI is to accelerate the development of broad-spectrum countermeasures. To achieve those goals, TMTI has a near term need to conduct analyses of genomic shift and drift trends of emerging pathogens, with a focused eye on select agent pathogens, as well as antibiotic and virulence markers. Most emerging human pathogens are zoonotic viruses with a genome composed of RNA. The high mutation rate of the replication enzymes of RNA viruses contributes to sequence drift and provides one mechanism for these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts (interspecies transmission events) and cause new human and zoonotic diseases. Additionally, new viral pathogens frequently emerge due to genetic shift (recombination and segment reassortment) which allows for dramatic genotypic and phenotypic changes to occur rapidly. Bacterial pathogens also evolve via genetic drift and shift, although sequence drift generally occurs at a much slower rate for bacteria as compared to RNA viruses. However, genetic shift such as lateral gene transfer and inter- and intragenomic recombination enables bacteria to rapidly acquire new mechanisms of survival and antibiotic resistance. New technologies such as rapid whole genome sequencing of bacterial genomes, ultra-deep sequencing of RNA virus populations, metagenomic studies of environments rich in antibiotic resistance genes, and the use of microarrays for the detection and characterization of emerging pathogens provide mechanisms to address the challenges posed by the rapid emergence of pathogens. Bioinformatic algorithms that enable efficient analysis of the massive amounts of data generated by these technologies as well computational modeling of protein structures and evolutionary processes need to be developed to allow the technology to fulfill its potential.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The rockfish genus Sebastes provides a unique model system for studying adaptive evolution because of the extensive diversity found within this group, which includes morphology, ecology, and a broad range of life spans. Examples of adaptive radiations within marine ecosystems are considered an anomaly due to the absence of geographical barriers and the presence of gene flow. Using marine rockfishes, we identified signatures of natural selection from transcriptomes developed from gonadal tissue of two rockfish species (Sebastes goodei and S. saxicola). We predicted orthologous transcript pairs, and estimated their distributions of nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates. Results: We identified 144 genes out of 1079 orthologous pairs under positive selection, of which 11 are functionally annotated to reproduction based on gene ontologies (GOs). One orthologous pair of the zona pellucida gene family, which is known for its role in the selection of sperm by oocytes, out of ten was identified to be evolving under positive selection. In addition to our results in the protein coding-regions of transcripts, we found substitution rates in 3’ and 5’ UTRs to be significantly lower than Ks substitution rates implying negative selection in these regions. Conclusions: We were able to identify a series of candidate genes that are useful for the assessment of the critical genes that diverged and are responsible for the radiation within this genus. Genes associated with longevity hold potential for understanding the molecular mechanisms that have contributed to the radiation within this genus.","Springer","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2015-09-02T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Genomics; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 656","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2164; PII: 1870","10.1186/s12864-015-1870-0","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1626788","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1626788","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1626788","BMC Genomics","1","16"

The goal of this study was to assess the role of SOST in aortic aneurysm (AA) and atherosclerosis using human samples, a mouse model, and in vitro investigations.</p> <p><strong>Approach and Results—</strong> SOST protein was downregulated in human and mouse AA samples compared with controls. Transgenic introduction of human SOST in apolipoprotein E–deficient (<em>ApoE<sup>–/–</sup></em>) mice (<em>SOST<sup>Tg</sup>.ApoE<sup>–/–</sup></em>) and administration of recombinant mouse Sost inhibited angiotensin II–induced AA and atherosclerosis. Serum concentrations of several proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in <em>SOST<sup>Tg</sup>.ApoE<sup>–/–</sup></em> mice. Compared with controls, the aortas of mice receiving recombinant mouse Sost and <em>SOST<sup>Tg</sup>.ApoE<sup>–/–</sup></em> mice showed reduced matrix degradation, reduced elastin breaks, and preserved collagen. Decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and a reduction in the expression of wingless-type mouse mammary virus integration site/β-catenin responsive genes, including matrix metalloproteinase-9, osteoprotegerin, and osteopontin, were observed in the aortas of <em>SOST<sup>Tg</sup>.ApoE<sup>–/–</sup></em> mice. SOST expression was downregulated and the wingless-type mouse mammary virus integration site/β-catenin pathway was activated in human AA samples.

Porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes, have been powerful crustacean models for environmental and evolutionary physiology with respect to thermal adaptation and understanding responses of marine organisms to climate change. Here, we present a large-scale EST sequencing and cDNA microarray database project for the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes. Methodology/Principal Findings: A set of ~;;30K unique sequences (UniSeqs) representing ~;;19K clusters were generated from ~;;98K high quality ESTs from a set of tissue specific non-normalized and mixed-tissue normalized cDNA libraries from the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes. Homology for each UniSeq was assessed using BLAST, InterProScan, GO and KEGG database searches. Approximately 66percent of the UniSeqs had homology in at least one of the databases. All EST and UniSeq sequences along with annotation results and coordinated cDNA microarray datasets have been made publicly accessible at the Porcelain Crab Array Database (PCAD), a feature-enriched version of the Stanford and Longhorn Array Databases.Conclusions/Significance: The EST project presented here represents the third largest sequencing effort for any crustacean, and the largest effort for any crab species. Our assembly and clustering results suggest that our porcelain crab EST data set is equally diverse to the much larger EST set generated in the Daphnia pulex genome sequencing project, and thus will be an important resource to the Daphnia research community. Our homology results support the pancrustacea hypothesis and suggest that Malacostraca may be ancestral to Branchiopoda and Hexapoda. Our results also suggest that our cDNA microarrays cover as much of the transcriptome as can reasonably be captured in EST library sequencing approaches, and thus represent a rich resource for studies of environmental genomics.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Consequently, metalloproteins have key roles in most biological processes, including respiration (iron and copper), photosynthesis (manganese) and drug metabolism (iron). Yet, predicting from genome sequence the numbers and types of metal an organism assimilates from its environment or uses in its metalloproteome is currently impossible because metal coordination sites are diverse and poorly recognized. We present here a robust, metal-based approach to determine all metals an organism assimilates and identify its metalloproteins on a genome-wide scale. This shifts the focus from classical protein-based purification to metal-based identification and purification by liquid chromatography, high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (HT-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to characterize cytoplasmic metalloproteins from an exemplary microorganism (Pyrococcus furiosus). Of 343 metal peaks in chromatography fractions, 158 did not match any predicted metalloprotein. Unassigned peaks included metals known to be used (cobalt, iron, nickel, tungsten and zinc; 83 peaks) plus metals the organism was not thought to assimilate (lead, manganese, molybdenum, uranium and vanadium; 75 peaks). Purification of eight of 158 unexpected metal peaks yielded four novel nickel- and molybdenum-containing proteins, whereas four purified proteins contained sub-stoichiometric amounts of misincorporated lead and uranium. Furthermore, analyses of two additional microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Sulfolobus solfataricus) revealed species-specific assimilation of yet more unexpected metals. Metalloproteomes are therefore much more extensive and diverse than previously recognized, and promise to provide key insights for cell biology, microbial growth and toxicity mechanisms.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2010-07-18T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature (London); Journal Volume: 466; Journal Issue: 7307","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 779-782","","","AC02-05CH11231; FG02-07ER64326","Journal ID: ISSN 0028-0836","10.1038/nature09265","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1797305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1797305","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1797305","Nature (London)","7307","466"

However, the molecular basis of its unique product specificity has remained elusive. Here, we present the structure of TbPRMT7 in complex with its cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) at 2.8 Å resolution and identify a glutamate residue critical for its monomethylation behavior. TbPRMT7 comprises the conserved methyltransferase and β-barrel domains, an N-terminal extension, and a dimerization arm. The active site at the interface of the N-terminal extension, methyltransferase, and β-barrel domains is stabilized by the dimerization arm of the neighboring protomer, providing a structural basis for dimerization as a prerequisite for catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of active-site residues highlights the importance of Glu181, the second of the two invariant glutamate residues of the double E loop that coordinate the target arginine in substrate peptides/proteins and that increase its nucleophilicity. Strikingly, mutation of Glu181 to aspartate converts TbPRMT7 into a type I PRMT, producing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a histone H4 peptide showed that the Glu181Asp mutant has markedly increased affinity for monomethylated peptide with respect to the WT, suggesting that the enlarged active site can favorably accommodate monomethylated peptide and provide sufficient space for ADMA formation. In conclusion, these findings yield valuable insights into the product specificity and the catalytic mechanism of protein arginine methyltransferases and have important implications for the rational (re)design of PRMTs.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2016-02-08T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; Journal Volume: 113; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2068-2073","","BNL-112763-2016-JA¿¿¿","SC00112704","Journal ID: ISSN 0027-8424","10.1073/pnas.1525783113","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1354247","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1354247","","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","8","113"

Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, natural disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we model these perturbations in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result in acute loss of proteostasis. Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes, which cells alleviate by activating proteostasis genes. Exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. With this being said, we propose that ribosome assembly is a key vulnerability of proteostasis maintenance in proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic perturbations that generate orphan r-proteins.</p>","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2019-03-07T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: eLife; Journal Volume: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e43002","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 2050-084X","10.7554/eLife.43002","","2022-05-25T04:00:00Z","1502812","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1502812","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1502812","eLife","","8"

It has shown a spectacular ability to adapt to a variety of solanaceaeous plants and variable climates during its global invasion, and, notably, to rapidly evolve insecticide resistance. To examine evidence of rapid evolutionary change, and to understand the genetic basis of herbivory and insecticide resistance, we tested for structural and functional genomic changes relative to other arthropod species using genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and community annotation. Two factors that might facilitate rapid evolutionary change include transposable elements, which comprise at least 17% of the genome and are rapidly evolving compared to other Coleoptera, and high levels of nucleotide diversity in rapidly growing pest populations. Adaptations to plant feeding are evident in gene expansions and differential expression of digestive enzymes in gut tissues, as well as expansions of gustatory receptors for bitter tasting. Surprisingly, the suite of genes involved in insecticide resistance is similar to other beetles. Finally, duplications in the RNAi pathway might explain why Leptinotarsa decemlineata has high sensitivity to dsRNA. In conclusion, the L. decemlineata genome provides opportunities to investigate a broad range of phenotypes and to develop sustainable methods to control this widely successful pest.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2018-01-31T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientific Reports; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1931","","","AC02-05CH11231; NHGRI U54 HG003273; K12 GM000708; 5R01GM080203; 5R01HG004483","Journal ID: ISSN 2045-2322; ark:/13030/qt8bt5g4s4","10.1038/s41598-018-20154-1","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1433138","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1433138","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1433138","Scientific Reports","1","8"

The organelle, which is crucial for motility, survival, differentiation, reproduction, division and feeding, among other activities, of many eukaryotes, is a great example of a natural nanomachine assembled mostly by proteins (around 350-650 of them) that have been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Flagellar proteins are discussed in terms of their arrangement on to the axoneme, the canonical “9+2” microtubule pattern, and also motor and sensorial elements that have been detected by recent proteomic analyses in organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, sea urchin, and trypanosomatids. Such findings can be remarkably matched up to important discoveries in vertebrate and mammalian types as diverse as sperm cells, ciliated kidney epithelia, respiratory and oviductal cilia, and neuro-epithelia, among others. Here we will focus on some exciting work regarding eukaryotic flagellar proteins, particularly using the flagellar proteome of C. reinhardtii as a reference map for exploring motility in function, dysfunction and pathogenic flagellates. The reference map for the eukaryotic flagellar proteome consists of 652 proteins that include known structural and intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins, less wellcharacterized signal transduction proteins and flagellar associated proteins (FAPs), besides almost two hundred unannotated conserved proteins, which lately have been the subject of intense investigation and of our present examination.","Bentham Science Publishers","","USDOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

This animal species is surprisingly well adapted to free life in the World Ocean inhabiting tidal costal zones of oceans and seas with warm to moderate temperatures and shallow waters. The genome of T. adhaerens (sp. Grell) includes four nuclear receptors, namely orthologue of RXR (NR2B), HNF4 (NR2A), COUP-TF (NR2F) and ERR (NR3B) that show a high degree of similarity with human orthologues. In the case of RXR, the sequence identity to human RXR alpha reaches 81% in the DNA binding domain and 70% in the ligand binding domain. We show that T. adhaerens RXR (TaRXR) binds 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) with high affinity, as well as high specificity and that exposure of T. adhaerens to 9-cis-RA regulates the expression of the putative T. adhaerens orthologue of vertebrate L-malate-NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.40) which in vertebrates is regulated by a heterodimer of RXR and thyroid hormone receptor. Treatment by 9-cis-RA alters the relative expression profile of T. adhaerens nuclear receptors, suggesting the existence of natural ligands. Keeping with this, algal food composition has a profound effect on T. adhaerens growth and appearance. We show that nanomolar concentrations of 9-cis-RA interfere with T. adhaerens growth response to specific algal food and causes growth arrest. Our results uncover an endocrine-like network of nuclear receptors sensitive to 9-cis-RA in T. adhaerens and support the existence of a ligand-sensitive network of nuclear receptors at the base of metazoan evolution.","PeerJ Inc.","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2017-09-29T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PeerJ; Journal Volume: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e3789","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2167-8359","10.7717/peerj.3789","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1628930","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1628930","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1628930","PeerJ","","5"
"Pan- and core- network analysis of co-expression genes in a model plant","He, Fei; Maslov, Sergei","60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; Computational biology and bioinformatics; Plant sciences","Genome-wide gene expression experiments have been performed using the model plant Arabidopsis during the last decade. Some studies involved construction of coexpression networks, a popular technique used to identify groups of co-regulated genes, to infer unknown gene functions. One approach is to construct a single coexpression network by combining multiple expression datasets generated in different labs. We advocate a complementary approach in which we construct a large collection of 134 coexpression networks based on expression datasets reported in individual publications. To this end we reanalyzed public expression data. To describe this collection of networks we introduced concepts of ‘pan-network’ and ‘core-network’ representing union and intersection between a sizeable fractions of individual networks, respectively. Here, we showed that these two types of networks are different both in terms of their topology and biological function of interacting genes. For example, the modules of the pan-network are enriched in regulatory and signaling functions, while the modules of the core-network tend to include components of large macromolecular complexes such as ribosomes and photosynthetic machinery. Our analysis is aimed to help the plant research community to better explore the information contained within the existing vast collection of gene expression data in Arabidopsis.","Nature Publishing Group","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States); Univ. of Illinois, Champaign, IL (United States).

Various plants have been genetically improved mostly through breeding, along with limited modification via genetic engineering, yet they are still not able to meet the ever-increasing needs, in terms of both quantity and quality, resulting from the rapid increase in world population and expected standards of living. A step change that may address these challenges would be to expand the potential of plants using biosystems design approaches. This represents a shift in plant science research from relatively simple trial-and-error approaches to innovative strategies based on predictive models of biological systems. Plant biosystems design seeks to accelerate plant genetic improvement using genome editing and genetic circuit engineering or create novel plant systems through de novo synthesis of plant genomes. From this perspective, we present a comprehensive roadmap of plant biosystems design covering theories, principles, and technical methods, along with potential applications in basic and applied plant biology research. We highlight current challenges, future opportunities, and research priorities, along with a framework for international collaboration, towards rapid advancement of this emerging interdisciplinary area of research. Finally, we discuss the importance of social responsibility in utilizing plant biosystems design and suggest strategies for improving public perception, trust, and acceptance.","AAAS","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States); Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (United States)","USDOE Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program; National Science Foundation (NSF); USDA; Chinese Academy of Forestry; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Leverhulme Trust; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Low Dose Radiation Response Curves, Networks and Pathways in Human Lymphoblastoid Cells Exposed from 1 to 10 cGy of Acute Gamma Radiation","Wyrobek, A J; Manohar, C F; Nelson, D O; Furtado, M R; Bhattacharya, M S; Marchetti, F; Coleman, M A","59; ANIMAL CELLS; BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS; BRAIN; DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS; GAMMA RADIATION; GENES; HOMEOSTASIS; MEMBRANES; RADIATIONS; SHAPE; TRANSCRIPTION; TRANSPORT","We investigated the low dose dependency of the transcriptional response of human cells to characterize the shape and biological functions associated with the dose response curve and to identify common and conserved functions of low dose expressed genes across cells and tissues. Human lymphoblastoid (HL) cells from two unrelated individuals were exposed to graded doses of radiation spanning the range of 1-10 cGy were analyzed by transcriptome profiling, qPCR and bioinformatics, in comparison to sham irradiated samples. A set of {approx}80 genes showed consistent responses in both cell lines; these genes were associated with homeostasis mechanisms (e.g., membrane signaling, molecule transport), subcellular locations (e.g., Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum), and involved diverse signal transduction pathways. The majority of radiation-modulated genes had plateau-like responses across 1-10 cGy, some with suggestive evidence that transcription was modulated at doses below 1 cGy. MYC, FOS and TP53 were the major network nodes of the low-dose response in HL cells. Comparison our low dose expression findings in HL cells with those of prior studies in mouse brain after whole body exposure, in human keratinocyte cultures, and in endothelial cells cultures, indicates that certain components of the low dose radiation response are broadly conserved across cell types and tissues, independent of proliferation status.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Histone H4 Acetylation Differentially Modulates Arginine Methylation by an in <i>Cis<\/i> Mechanism","Feng, You; Wang, Juxian; Asher, Sabrina; Hoang, Linh; Guardiani, Carlo; Ivanov, Ivaylo; Zheng, Y. George","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Histone H4 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs) at its N-terminal tail. Many of these PTMs profoundly affect the on and off status of gene transcription. The molecular mechanism by which histone PTMs modulate genetic and epigenetic processes is not fully understood. In particular, how a PTM mark affects the presence and level of other histone modification marks needs to be addressed and is essential for better understanding the molecular basis of histone code hypothesis. To dissect the interplaying relationship between different histone modification marks, we investigated how individual lysine acetylations and their different combinations at the H4 tail affect Arg-3 methylation in cis. Our data reveal that the effect of lysine acetylation on arginine methylation depends on the site of acetylation and the type of methylation. Although certain acetylations present a repressive impact on PRMT1-mediated methylation (type I methylation), lysine acetylation generally is correlated with enhanced methylation by PRMT5 (type II dimethylation). In particular, Lys-5 acetylation decreases the activity of PRMT1 but increases that of PRMT5. Furthermore, circular dichroism study and computer simulation demonstrate that hyperacetylation increases the content of ordered secondary structures at the H4 tail region. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of Arg-3 methylation by H4 acetylation and unravel the complex intercommunications that exist between different the PTM marks in cis. The divergent activities of PRMT1 and PRMT5 with respect to different acetyl-H4 substrates suggest that type I and type II protein-arginine methyltransferases use distinct molecular determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis.","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In neurons, a Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>A-domain/RIM zinc-finger domain (ZF) heterodimer couples synaptic vesicle priming to presynaptic plasticity. We now show that the Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>A domain homodimerizes, and that homodimerization competes with Munc13–1/RIM heterodimerization. X-ray diffraction studies guided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments reveal the crystal structures of the Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>A-domain homodimer and the Munc13–1 C2A-domain/RIM ZF heterodimer at 1.44 Å and 1.78 Å resolution, respectively. The C2A domain adopts a bsandwich structure with a four-stranded concave side that mediates homodimerization, leading to the formation of an eight-stranded b-barrel. In contrast, heterodimerization involves the bottom tip of the C<sub>2</sub>A-domain β-sandwich and a C-terminal α-helical extension, which wrap around the RIM ZF domain. Our results describe the structural basis for a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/RIM heterodimer switch that may be crucial for vesicle priming and presynaptic plasticity, uncovering at the same time an unexpected versatility of C<sub>2</sub> domains as protein–protein interaction modules, and illustrating the power of combining NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to study protein complexes.","Public Library of Science","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States); University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2006-06-06T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS Biology (Online); Journal Volume: 4; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e192","","","W-31–109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 1545-7885","10.1371/journal.pbio.0040192","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1627147","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627147","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627147","PLoS Biology (Online)","7","4"
"A glutamate/aspartate switch controls product specificity in a protein arginine methyltransferase","Debler, Erik W.; Jain, Kanishk; Warmack, Rebeccah A.; Feng, You; Clarke, Steven G.; Blobel, Günter; Stavropoulos, Pete","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; crystal structure; enzyme catalysis; PRMT; histone methylation; epigenetics","<em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> PRMT7 (<em>Tb</em>PRMT7) is a protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) that strictly monomethylates various substrates, thus classifying it as a type III PRMT. However, the molecular basis of its unique product specificity has remained elusive. Here, in this work, we present the structure of <em>Tb</em>PRMT7 in complex with its cofactor product <em>S</em>-adenosyl-<span class=""sc"">l</span>-homocysteine (AdoHcy) at 2.8 Å resolution and identify a glutamate residue critical for its monomethylation behavior. <em>Tb</em>PRMT7 comprises the conserved methyltransferase and β-barrel domains, an N-terminal extension, and a dimerization arm. The active site at the interface of the N-terminal extension, methyltransferase, and β-barrel domains is stabilized by the dimerization arm of the neighboring protomer, providing a structural basis for dimerization as a prerequisite for catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of active-site residues highlights the importance of Glu181, the second of the two invariant glutamate residues of the double E loop that coordinate the target arginine in substrate peptides/proteins and that increase its nucleophilicity. Strikingly, mutation of Glu181 to aspartate converts <em>Tb</em>PRMT7 into a type I PRMT, producing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a histone H4 peptide showed that the Glu181Asp mutant has markedly increased affinity for monomethylated peptide with respect to the WT, suggesting that the enlarged active site can favorably accommodate monomethylated peptide and provide sufficient space for ADMA formation. In conclusion, these findings yield valuable insights into the product specificity and the catalytic mechanism of protein arginine methyltransferases and have important implications for the rational (re)design of PRMTs.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

"Synthesizing and Salvaging NAD+: Lessons Learned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","Lin, Huawen; Kwan, Alan L.; Dutcher, Susan K.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Genetics & Heredity","The essential coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) plays important roles in metabolic reactions and cell regulation in all organisms. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals use different pathways to synthesize NAD+ . Our molecular and genetic data demonstrate that in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas NAD+ is synthesized from aspartate (de novo synthesis), as in plants, or nicotinamide, as in mammals (salvage synthesis). The de novo pathway requires five different enzymes: L-aspartate oxidase (ASO), quinolinate synthetase (QS), quinolate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPT), nicotinate/ nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), and NAD+ synthetase (NS). Sequence similarity searches, gene isolation and sequencing of mutant loci indicate that mutations in each enzyme result in a nicotinamide-requiring mutant phenotype in the previously isolated nic mutants. We rescued the mutant phenotype by the introduction of BAC DNA (nic2- 1 and nic13-1) or plasmids with cloned genes (nic1-1 and nic15-1) into the mutants. NMNAT, which is also in the de novo pathway, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) constitute the nicotinamide-dependent salvage pathway. A mutation in NAMPT (npt1-1) has no obvious growth defect and is not nicotinamide-dependent. However, double mutant strains with the npt1-1 mutation and any of the nic mutations are inviable. When the de novo pathway is inactive, the salvage pathway is essential to Chlamydomonas for the synthesis of NAD+ . A homolog of the human SIRT6-like gene, SRT2, is upregulated in the NS mutant, which shows a longer vegetative life span than wild-type cells. Our results suggest that Chlamydomonas is an excellent model system to study NAD+ metabolism and cell longevity.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Imaging gene expression in real-time using aptamers","Shin, Ilchung","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Pure sciences; Biological sciences; Aptamers; Gene expression; Promoter activity; Rna reporter; Transcription","Signal transduction pathways are usually activated by external stimuli and are transient. The downstream changes such as transcription of the activated genes are also transient. Real-time detection of promoter activity is useful for understanding changes in gene expression, especially during cell differentiation and in development. A simple and reliable method for viewing gene expression in real time is not yet available. Reporter proteins such as fluorescent proteins and luciferase allow for non-invasive detection of the products of gene expression in living cells. However, current reporter systems do not provide for real-time imaging of promoter activity in living cells. This is because of the long time period after transcription required for fluorescent protein synthesis and maturation. We have developed an RNA reporter system for imaging in real-time to detect changes in promoter activity as they occur. The RNA reporter uses strings of RNA aptamers that constitute IMAGEtags (Intracellular MultiAptamer GEnetic tags), which can be expressed from a promoter of choice. The tobramycin, neomycin and PDC RNA aptamers have been utilized for this system and expressed in yeast from the GAL1 promoter. The IMAGEtag RNA kinetics were quantified by RT-qPCR. In yeast precultured in raffinose containing media the GAL1 promoter responded faster than in yeast precultured in glucose containing media. IMAGEtag RNA has relatively short half-life (5.5 min) in yeast. For imaging, the yeast cells are incubated with their ligands that are labeled with fluorescent dyes. To increase signal to noise, ligands have been separately conjugated with the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) pairs, Cy3 and Cy5. With these constructs, the transcribed aptamers can be imaged after activation of the promoter by galactose. FRET was confirmed with three different approaches, which were sensitized emission, acceptor photobleaching and donor lifetime by FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy). Real-time transcription was measured by FLIM-FRET, which was detected by the decrease in donor lifetime resulting from ligand binding to IMAGEtags that were newly synthesized from the activated GAL1 promoter. The FRET signal was specific for transcribed IMAGEtags.","","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2012-01-01T05:00:00Z","English","Thesis/Dissertation","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 118 p.","","IS-T-3080","AC02-07CH11358; 1R01 EB005075","","10.2172/1082970","","2017-08-08T04:00:00Z","1082970","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1082970","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1082970","","",""

Generally, the acquisition of genes in the form of pathogenicity islands distinguishes pathogenic isolates from nonpathogens. We therefore sequenced a highly virulent strain of P. aeruginosa, PA14, and compared it with a previously sequenced (and less pathogenic) strain, PAO1, to identify novel virulence genes. The PA14 and PAO1 genomes are remarkably similar, although PA14 has a slightly larger genome (6.5 megabses [Mb]) than does PAO1 (6.3 Mb). We identified 58 PA14 gene clusters that are absent in PAO1 to determine which of these genes, if any, contribute to its enhanced virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans pathogenicity model. First, we tested 18 additional diverse strains in the C. elegans model and observed a wide range of pathogenic potential; however, genotyping these strains using a custom microarray showed that the presence of PA14 genes that are absent in PAO1 did not correlate with the virulence of these strains. Second, we utilized a full-genome nonredundant mutant library of PA14 to identify five genes (absent in PAO1) required for C. elegans killing. Surprisingly, although these five genes are present in many other P. aeruginosa strains, they do not correlate with virulence in C. elegans. Genes required for pathogenicity in one strain of P. aeruginosa are neither required for nor predictive of virulence in other strains. We therefore propose that virulence in this organism is both multifactorial and combinatorial, the result of a pool of pathogenicity-related genes that interact in various combinations in different genetic backgrounds.","BioMed Central","","Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Jane Coffin Childs Memorial fund; Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics","","United States","2006-10-12T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: GenomeBiology.com; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. R90 (2006)","","","FG02-ER63445; U01 HL66678; R01 AI064332","Journal ID: ISSN 1465-6906; PII: gb-2006-7-10-r90","10.1186/gb-2006-7-10-r90","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1626705","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1626705","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1626705","GenomeBiology.com","10","7"

In fact, given their optimal catalytic activity and operational stability under harsh physical and chemical conditions, they represent a suitable alternative to their mesophilic counterparts. For instance, extremophilic enzymes are important to foster the switch from fossil-based to lignocellulose-based industrial processes. Indeed, more stable enzymes are needed, because the conversion of the lignocellulosic biomass to a wide palette of value-added products requires extreme chemo-physical pre-treatments. Galactomannans are part of the hemicellulose fraction in lignocellulosic biomass. They are heteropolymers constituted by a $β$-1,4-linked mannan backbone substituted with side chains of α-1,6-linked galactose residues. Therefore, the joint action of different hydrolytic enzymes (i.e. $β$-mannanase, $β$-mannosidase and $α$-galactosidase) is needed to accomplish their complete hydrolysis. So far, numerous galactomannan-degrading enzymes have been isolated and characterized from extremophilic microorganisms. Besides applications in biorefinery, these biocatalysts are also useful to improve the quality (i.e. digestibility and prebiotic properties) of food and feed as well as in paper industries to aid the pulp bleaching process. In this review, an overview about the structure, function and applications of galactomannans is provided. Moreover, a survey of (hyper)-thermophilic galactomannans-degrading enzymes, mainly characterized in the last decade, has been carried out. These extremozymes are described in the light of their biotechnological application in industrial processes requiring harsh conditions.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2019-01-30T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 32","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0959-3993; ark:/13030/qt7ns3c95z","10.1007/s11274-019-2591-3","","2023-06-30T04:00:00Z","1580815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1580815","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1580815","World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology","2","35"

While there have been many one-off workshops and meeting on synthetic biology, the 2014 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) was the first of an annual conference series that serves as a reliable place to pull together the involved disciplines in order to organize and exchange advances in the science and technology in the field. Further, the SEED conferences have a strong focus on industry, with many companies represented and actively participating. A number of these companies have started major efforts in synthetic biology including large companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Dow, Dupont, BP, Total), smaller companies have recently gone public (e.g., Amyris, Gevo, Intrexon), and many start-ups (e.g., Teslagen, Refactored Materials, Pivot, Genomatica). There are a number of loosely affiliated Synthetic Biology Centers, including ones at MIT, Boston University, UCSD, UCSF, UC-Berkeley, Imperial College, Oxford, and ETH. SEED 2015 will serve as the primary meeting at which international synthetic biology centers and related infrastructure (synthesis/software/foundries) meet to discuss technology, standards, and education. SEED2015 will be the second in an annual series of meeting held to bring researchers from industry and academia in the area of Synthetic Biology. The first SEED conference was highly successful, attracting 285 attendees with varying backgrounds from academia, industry and government. The SEED series provides leadership in the development of the field of synthetic biology and serves to broaden the participants in the field by appealing to broad sectors in industry and providing a means for young investigators and those outside of the field to participate. Further, the series closely integrates with groups such as the SBCC to provide a means by which the synthetic biology community can communicate with policy makers. Further, we will pursue making the meeting the center for the exchange of educational materials as centers for synthetic biology emerge globally. Proceedings will be published each year in the journal ACS Synthetic Biology. After each SEED meeting, surveys are distributed to assess the success of the conference and to help guide changes year-to-year. The diverse application areas further extend the expertise needed from people in areas such as plant biology, agriculture and soil science, environmental science, medicine, and the chemical industry. These areas could have a widespread impact on society in a number of ways. For example, the CRISPR/Cas9 system that serves to immunize bacteria from phage has provided the fundamental chemistry that is used to edit the genomes of diverse organisms, including human stem cells, crop plants, and livestock animals.","","","American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), New York, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","J.

ECO includes diverse terms for categorizing evidence that supports annotation assertions including experimental types, computational methods, author statements and curator inferences. Using ECO, annotation assertions can be distinguished according to the evidence they are based on such as those made by curators versus those automatically computed or those made via high-throughput data review versus single test experiments. Originally created for capturing evidence associated with Gene Ontology annotations, ECO is now used in other capacities by many additional annotation resources including UniProt, Mouse Genome Informatics, Saccharomyces Genome Database, PomBase, the Protein Information Resource and others.

Current targets for structure determination have beenselected in six major stages, starting with those predicted to be mosttractable to high throughput study and likely to yield new structuralinformation. We report on the process used to select these proteins, aswell as our target deselection procedure. Target deselection reducesexperimental effort by eliminating targets similar to those recentlysolved by the structural biology community or other centers. We measurethe impact of the 69 structures solved at the BSGC as of July 2004 onstructure prediction coverage of the M. pneumoniae and M. genitaliumproteomes. The number of Mycoplasma proteins for which thefold couldfirst be reliably assigned based on structures solved at the BSGC (24 M.pneumoniae and 21 M. genitalium) is approximately 25 percent of the totalresulting from work at all structural genomics centers and the worldwidestructural biology community (94 M. pneumoniae and 86M. genitalium)during the same period. As the number of structures contributed by theBSGC during that period is less than 1 percent of the total worldwideoutput, the benefits of a focused target selection strategy are apparent.If the structures of all current targets were solved, the percentage ofM. pneumoniae proteins for which folds could be reliably assigned wouldincrease from approximately 57 percent (391 of 687) at present to around80 percent (550 of 687), and the percentage of the proteome that could beaccurately modeled would increase from around 37 percent (254 of 687) toabout 64 percent (438 of 687).

Its genome and a set of dehydration–rehydration transcriptomes, together with the genome of Polypedilum nubifer (a congeneric desiccation-sensitive midge), were recently released. Here, using published and newly generated datasets reflecting detailed transcriptome changes during anhydrobiosis, as well as a developmental series, we show that the TCTAGAA DNA motif, which closely resembles the binding motif of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock transcription activator (Hsf), is significantly enriched in the promoter regions of desiccation-induced genes in P. vanderplanki, such as genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, thioredoxins, or trehalose metabolism-related genes, but not in P. nubifer. Unlike P. nubifer, P. vanderplanki has double TCTAGAA sites upstream of the Hsf gene itself, which is probably responsible for the stronger activation of Hsf in P. vanderplanki during desiccation compared with P. nubifer. To confirm the role of Hsf in desiccation-induced gene activation, we used the Pv11 cell line, derived from P. vanderplanki embryo. After preincubation with trehalose, Pv11 cells can enter anhydrobiosis and survive desiccation. We showed that Hsf knockdown suppresses trehalose-induced activation of multiple predicted Hsf targets (including P. vanderplanki-specific LEA protein genes) and reduces the desiccation survival rate of Pv11 cells fivefold. Finally, cooption of the heat shock regulatory system has been an important evolutionary mechanism for adaptation to desiccation in P. vanderplanki.","National Academy of Sciences","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Imaging gene expression in real-time using aptamers","Shin, Il Chung","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Signal transduction pathways are usually activated by external stimuli and are transient. The downstream changes such as transcription of the activated genes are also transient. Real-time detection of promoter activity is useful for understanding changes in gene expression, especially during cell differentiation and in development. A simple and reliable method for viewing gene expression in real time is not yet available. Reporter proteins such as fluorescent proteins and luciferase allow for non-invasive detection of the products of gene expression in living cells. However, current reporter systems do not provide for real-time imaging of promoter activity in living cells. This is because of the long time period after transcription required for fluorescent protein synthesis and maturation. We have developed an RNA reporter system for imaging in real-time to detect changes in promoter activity as they occur. The RNA reporter uses strings of RNA aptamers that constitute IMAGEtags (Intracellular MultiAptamer GEnetic tags), which can be expressed from a promoter of choice. The tobramycin, neomycin and PDC RNA aptamers have been utilized for this system and expressed in yeast from the GAL1 promoter. The IMAGEtag RNA kinetics were quantified by RT-qPCR. In yeast precultured in raffinose containing media the GAL1 promoter responded faster than in yeast precultured in glucose containing media. IMAGEtag RNA has relatively short half-life (5.5 min) in yeast. For imaging, the yeast cells are incubated with their ligands that are labeled with fluorescent dyes. To increase signal to noise, ligands have been separately conjugated with the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) pairs, Cy3 and Cy5. With these constructs, the transcribed aptamers can be imaged after activation of the promoter by galactose. FRET was confirmed with three different approaches, which were sensitized emission, acceptor photobleaching and donor lifetime by FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy). Real-time transcription was measured by FLIM-FRET, which was detected by the decrease in donor lifetime resulting from ligand binding to IMAGEtags that were newly synthesized from the activated GAL1 promoter. The FRET signal was specific for transcribed IMAGEtags.","","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2011-01-01T05:00:00Z","English","Thesis/Dissertation","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 118 p.","","IS-T 3043","AC02-07CH11358","","10.2172/1048515","","2016-07-06T04:00:00Z","1048515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1048515","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1048515","","",""

The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models.

The developments to follow will signal a significant paradigm shift in the clinical management of human cancer. Despite our initial hopes, however, it seems that simple analysis of microarray data cannot elucidate clinically significant gene functions and mechanisms. Extracting biological information from microarray data requires a complicated path involving multidisciplinary teams of biomedical researchers, computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computational linguists. The integration of the diverse outputs of each team is the limiting factor in the progress to discover candidate genes and pathways associated with the molecular biology of cancer. Specifically, one must deal with sets of significant genes identified by each method and extract whatever useful information may be found by comparing these different gene lists. Here we present our experience with such comparisons, and share methods developed in the analysis of an infant leukemia cohort studied on Affymetrix HG-U95A arrays. In particular, spatial gene clustering, hyper-dimensional projections, and computational linguistics were used to compare different gene lists. In spatial gene clustering, different gene lists are grouped together and visualized on a three-dimensional expression map, where genes with similar expressions are co-located. In another approach, projections from gene expression space onto a sphere clarify how groups of genes can jointly have more predictive power than groups of individually selected genes. Finally, online literature is automatically rearranged to present information about genes common to multiple groups, or to contrast the differences between the lists. The combination of these methods has improved our understanding of infant leukemia. While the complicated reality of the biology dashed our initial, optimistic hopes for simple answers from microarrays, we have made progress by combining very different analytic approaches.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2004-01-01T05:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 21 p.","","SAND2004-0161","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200818%%378","10.2172/918393","","2021-08-11T04:00:00Z","918393","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/918393","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/918393","","",""

Berkeley Lab programs advance four distinct goals for DOE and the nation: (1) To perform leading multidisciplinary research in the computing sciences, physical sciences, energy sciences, biosciences, and general sciences in a manner that ensures employee and public safety and protection of the environment. (2) To develop and operate unique national experimental facilities for qualified investigators. (3) To educate and train future generations of scientists and engineers to promote national science and education goals. (4) To transfer knowledge and technological innovations and to foster productive relationships among Berkeley Lab's research programs, universities, and industry in order to promote national economic competitiveness. In FY03, Berkeley Lab was authorized by DOE to establish a funding ceiling for the LDRD program of $15.0 M, which equates to about 3.2% of Berkeley Lab's FY03 projected operating and capital equipment budgets. This funding level was provided to develop new scientific ideas and opportunities and allow the Berkeley Lab Director an opportunity to initiate new directions. Budget constraints limited available resources, however, so only $10.1 M was expended for operating and $0.6 M for capital equipment (2.4% of actual Berkeley Lab FY03 costs). In FY03, scientists submitted 168 proposals, requesting over $24.2 M in operating funding. Eighty-two projects were funded, with awards ranging from $45 K to $500 K.

To further examine the extent of redundancy within the RUB pathway, we undertook biochemical and genetic characterizations of one such duplication event- the duplication of the genes encoding a subunit of the RUB E1 into AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AXR1) and AXR1- LIKE1 (AXL1). In vitro, the two proteins have similar abilities to function with E1 C-TERMINAL-RELATED1 (ECR1) in catalyzing RUB1 activation and RUB1-ECR1 thioester formation. Using mass spectrometry, endogenous AXR1 and AXL1 proteins were found in complex with 3HARUB1, suggesting that AXR1 and AXL1 exist in parallel RUB E1 complexes in Arabidopsis. In contrast, AXR1 and AXL1 differ in ability to correct phenotypic defects in axr1- 30, a severe loss-of-function AXR1 mutant, when the respective coding sequences are expressed from the same promoter, suggesting differential in vivo functions. These results suggest that while both proteins function in the RUB pathway and are biochemically similar in RUB-ECR1 thioester formation, they are not functionally equivalent.","Springer","","Univ. of California, Davis, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Dual function of Rpn5 in two PCI complexes, the 26S proteasome and COP9 signalosome","Yu, Zanlin; Kleifeld, Oded; Lande-Atir, Avigail; Bsoul, Maisa; Kleiman, Maya; Krutauz, Daria; Book, Adam; Vierstra, Richard D.; Hofmann, Kay; Reis, Noa; Glickman, Michael H.; Pick, Elah","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Cell Biology","Subunit composition and architectural structure of the 26S proteasome lid is strictly conserved between all eukaryotes. This eight-subunit complex bears high similarity to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 and to the COP9 signalosome (CSN), which together define the proteasome CSN/COP9/initiation factor (PCI) troika. In some unicellular eukaryotes, the latter two complexes lack key subunits, encouraging questions about the conservation of their structural design. Here we demonstrate that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rpn5 plays dual roles by stabilizing proteasome and CSN structures independently. Proteasome and CSN complexes are easily dissected, with Rpn5 the only subunit in common. Together with Rpn5, we identified a total of six bona fide subunits at roughly stoichiometric ratios in isolated, affinity-purified CSN. Moreover, the copy of Rpn5 associated with the CSN is required for enzymatic hydrolysis of Rub1/Nedd8 conjugated to cullins. We propose that multitasking by a single subunit, Rpn5 in this case, allows it to function in different complexes simultaneously. These observations demonstrate that functional substitution of subunits by paralogues is feasible, implying that the canonical composition of the three PCI complexes in S. cerevisiae is more robust than hitherto appreciated.","American Society for Cell Biology","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

However, the pretreatment process generates inhibitory compounds that impair the growth and fermentation performance of microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pinewood specifically has been shown to be challenging in obtaining industrially relevant ethanol titers. An industrial S. cerevisiae strain was subjected to directed evolution and adaptation in pretreated pine biomass and resultant strains, GHP1 and GHP4, exhibited improved growth and fermentative ability on pretreated pine in the presence of related inhibitory compounds. A comparative transcriptomic approach was applied to identify and characterize differences in phenotypic stability of evolved strains. Results: Evolved strains displayed different fermentative capabilities with pretreated pine that appear to be influenced by the addition or absence of 13 inhibitory compounds during pre-culturing. GHP4 performance was consistent independent of culturing conditions, while GHP1 performance was dependent on culturing with inhibitors. Comparative transcriptomics revealed 52 genes potentially associated with stress responses to multiple inhibitors simultaneously. Fluorescence microscopy revealed improved cellular integrity of both strains with mitochondria exhibiting resistance to the damaging effects of inhibitors in contrast to the parent. Conclusions: Multiple potentially novel genetic targets have been discovered for understanding stress tolerance through the characterization of our evolved strains. This study specifically examines the synergistic effects of multiple inhibitors and identified targets will guide future studies in remediating effects of inhibitors and further development of robust yeast strains for multiple industrial applications.","BioMed Central","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); USDOE","","United States","2016-09-20T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biotechnology for Biofuels; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 200","","","SC0010687; DOE-EE000410","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-6834; PII: 614","10.1186/s13068-016-0614-y","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1618649","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1618649","","Biotechnology for Biofuels","1","9"

A dataset of 56 microarray-defined, muscle-enriched exons and their flanking introns were examined computationally in order to investigate coordination of the muscle splicing program. Candidate intron regulatory motifs were required to meet several stringent criteria: significant over-representation near muscle-enriched exons, correlation with muscle expression, and phylogenetic conservation among genomes of several vertebrate orders. Three classes of regulatory motifs were identified in the proximal downstream intron, within 200nt of the target exons: UGCAUG, a specific binding site for Fox-1 related splicing factors; ACUAAC, a novel branchpoint-like element; and UG-/UGC-rich elements characteristic of binding sites for CELF splicing factors. UGCAUG was remarkably enriched, being present in nearly one-half of all cases. These studies suggest that Fox and CELF splicing factors play a major role in enforcing the muscle-specific alternative splicing program, facilitating expression of a set of unique isoforms of cytoskeletal proteins that are critical to muscle cell differentiation. Supplementary materials: There are four supplementary tables and one supplementary figure. The tables provide additional detailed information concerning the muscle-enriched datasets, and about over-represented oligonucleotide sequences in the flanking introns. The supplementary figure shows RT-PCR data confirming the muscle-enriched expression of exons predicted from the microarray analysis.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality (human, mouse, fly and worm), there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome, published in 2006, was noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes. Results: Here, we report an improved honey bee genome assembly (Amel_4.5) with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2), and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes, contrary to what was suggested in OGSv1.0. The new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes ~5000 more protein-coding genes, 50% more than previously reported. About 1/6 of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly, and the remaining were inferred based on new RNAseq and protein data. Conclusions: Lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects. Furthermore, the improvements significantly enhance genomic resources for the honey bee, a key model for social behavior and essential to global ecology through pollination.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

How these adaptors/receptors selectively interact with either LC3 or GABARAP families remains unclear. Herein, we determine the range of selectivity of 30 known core LIR motifs towards individual LC3s and GABARAPs. From these, we define a GABARAP Interaction Motif (GIM) sequence ([W/F]–[V/I]–X<sub>2</sub>–V) that the adaptor protein PLEKHM1 tightly conforms to. Using biophysical and structural approaches, we show that the PLEKHM1–LIR is indeed 11–fold more specific for GABARAP than LC3B. Selective mutation of the X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> positions either completely abolished the interaction with all LC3 and GABARAPs or increased PLEKHM1–GIM selectivity 20–fold towards LC3B. Finally, we show that conversion of p62/SQSTM1, FUNDC1 and FIP200 LIRs into our newly defined GIM, by introducing two valine residues, enhances their interaction with endogenous GABARAP over LC3B. In conclusion, the identification of a GABARAP–specific interaction motif will aid the identification and characterization of the expanding array of autophagy receptor and adaptor proteins and their <i>in vivo</i> functions.","European Molecular Biology Organization","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-06-27T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EMBO Reports; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1382-1396","","","AC02-76SF00515; SFB 1177; EXC115; SPP 1580; HFSP RGP55; UOCX1208; W911NF‐11‐1‐0481; UOC1013; UOC1506; FY2012; Az. 10.14.2.208; 202061/Z/16/Z; T16/44","Journal ID: ISSN 1469-221X","10.15252/embr.201643587","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1390293","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1390293","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1390293","EMBO Reports","8","18"

In budding yeast, the kinetochore–microtubule interface is formed by the plus end–associated Dam1 complex and the kinetochore-resident Ndc80 complex, but how they work in combination and whether a physical association between them is critical for chromosome segregation is poorly understood. Here, we define structural elements required for the Ndc80–Dam1 interaction and probe their function in vivo. A novel ndc80 allele, selectively impaired in Dam1 binding, displayed growth and chromosome segregation defects. Its combination with an N-terminal truncation resulted in lethality, demonstrating essential but partially redundant roles for the Ndc80 N-tail and Ndc80–Dam1 interface. In contrast, mutations in the calponin homology domain of Ndc80 abrogated kinetochore function and were not compensated by the presence of Dam1. Our experiments shed light on how microtubule couplers cooperate and impose important constraints on structural models for outer kinetochore assembly.","Rockefeller University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

User-friendly and yet responsive access is one of the most desirable properties for integrated access to the rapidly growing, heterogeneous, and distributed collection of data sources. The increasing volume and diversity of digital information related to bioinformatics (such as genomes, protein sequences, protein structures, etc.) have led to a growing problem that conventional data management systems do not have, namely finding which information sources out of many candidate choices are the most relevant and most accessible to answer a given user query. We refer to this problem as the query routing problem. In this paper we introduce the notation and issues of query routing, and present a practical solution for designing a scalable query routing system based on multi-level progressive pruning strategies. The key idea is to create and maintain source-capability profiles independently, and to provide algorithms that can dynamically discover relevant information sources for a given query through the smart use of source profiles. Compared to the keyword-based indexing techniques adopted in most of the search engines and software, our approach offers fine-granularity of interest matching, thus it is more powerful and effective for handling queries with complex conditions.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

As the major sensor of UPR in eukaryotes, IRE1, in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, catalyzes the unconventional splicing of HAC1 in yeast, bZIP60 in plants and XBP1 in metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IRE1p and HAC1 mRNA, the only UPR pathway found in yeast, evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust UPR induction. However, the functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of IRE1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established. Here, we report that IRE1 and its substrate bZIP60 function as a strictly cognate enzymesubstrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants. Moreover, we show that the S1P/ S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway, the other known branch of UPR in plants, does not play a detectable role in virus infection, demonstrating the distinct function of the IRE1-bZIP60 pathway in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that bZIP60 and HAC1, products of the enzyme-substrate duet, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with ER stress in yeast. Taken together, we conclude that the downstream signaling of the IRE1- mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants, and that the IRE1-bZIP60 UPR pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other UPR branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus-plant interactions.","Public Library of Science","","Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Institutes of Health (NIH); US Department of Agriculture (USDA)","","United States","2015-04-15T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS Genetics; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e1005164","","","SC0014664; R01 GM101038; 2014-67014-21715","Journal ID: ISSN 1553-7404","10.1371/journal.pgen.1005164","","2023-07-10T04:00:00Z","1904889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1904889","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1904889","PLoS Genetics","4","11"

"Molecular mechanism of Aurora A kinase autophosphorylation and its allosteric activation by TPX2","Zorba, Adelajda; Buosi, Vanessa; Kutter, Steffen; Kern, Nadja; Pontiggia, Francesco; Cho, Young-Jin; Kern, Dorothee","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","We elucidate the molecular mechanisms of two distinct activation strategies (autophosphorylation and TPX2-mediated activation) in human Aurora A kinase. Classic allosteric activation is in play where either activation loop phosphorylation or TPX2 binding to a conserved hydrophobic groove shifts the equilibrium far towards the active conformation. We resolve the controversy about the mechanism of autophosphorylation by demonstrating intermolecular autophosphorylation in a long-lived dimer by combining X-ray crystallography with functional assays. We then address the allosteric activation by TPX2 through activity assays and the crystal structure of a domain-swapped dimer of dephosphorylated Aurora A and TPX21-25. While autophosphorylation is the key regulatory mechanism in the centrosomes in the early stages of mitosis, allosteric activation by TPX2 of dephosphorylated Aurora A could be at play in the spindle microtubules. The mechanistic insights into autophosphorylation and allosteric activation by TPX2 binding proposed here, may have implications for understanding regulation of other protein kinases.","eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd.","","Brandeis Univ., Waltham, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

With the publication in 2004 of a trio of manuscripts describing the finished 'DOE Human Chromosomes', the Institute successfully completed its human genome mission. In the time between the creation of the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) and completion of the Human Genome Project, sequencing and its role in biology spread to fields extending far beyond what could be imagined when the Human Genome Project first began. Accordingly, the targets of the DOE JGI's sequencing activities changed, moving from a single human genome to the genomes of large numbers of microbes, plants, and other organisms, and the community of users of DOE JGI data similarly expanded and diversified. Transitioning into operating as a user facility, the DOE JGI modeled itself after other DOE user facilities, such as synchrotron light sources and supercomputer facilities, empowering the science of large numbers of investigators working in areas of relevance to energy and the environment. The JGI's approach to being a user facility is based on the concept that by focusing state-of-the-art sequencing and analysis capabilities on the best peer-reviewed ideas drawn from a broad community of scientists, the DOE JGI will effectively encourage creative approaches to DOE mission areas and produce important science. This clearly has occurred, only partially reflected in the fact that the DOE JGI has played a major role in more than 45 papers published in just the past three years alone in Nature and Science. The involvement of a large and engaged community of users working on important problems has helped maximize the impact of JGI science. A seismic technological change is presently underway at the JGI. The Sanger capillary-based sequencing process that dominated how sequencing was done in the last decade is being replaced by a variety of new processes and sequencing instruments. The JGI, with an increasing number of next-generation sequencers, whose throughput is 100- to 1,000-fold greater than the Sanger capillary-based sequencers, is increasingly focused in new directions on projects of scale and complexity not previously attempted. These new directions for the JGI come, in part, from the 2008 National Research Council report on the goals of the National Plant Genome Initiative as well as the 2007 National Research Council report on the New Science of Metagenomics. Both reports outline a crucial need for systematic large-scale surveys of the plant and microbial components of the biosphere as well as an increasing need for large-scale analysis capabilities to meet the challenge of converting sequence data into knowledge. The JGI is extensively discussed in both reports as vital to progress in these fields of major national interest. JGI's future plan for plants and microbes includes a systematic approach for investigation of these organisms at a scale requiring the special capabilities of the JGI to generate, manage, and analyze the datasets. JGI will generate and provide not only community access to these plant and microbial datasets, but also the tools for analyzing them. These activities will produce essential knowledge that will be needed if we are to be able to respond to the world's energy and environmental challenges. As the JGI Plant and Microbial programs advance, the JGI as a user facility is also evolving. The Institute has been highly successful in bending its technical and analytical skills to help users solve large complex problems of major importance, and that effort will continue unabated. The JGI will increasingly move from a central focus on 'one-off' user projects coming from small user communities to much larger scale projects driven by systematic and problem-focused approaches to selection of sequencing targets. Entire communities of scientists working in a particular field, such as feedstock improvement or biomass degradation, will be users of this information. Despite this new emphasis, an investigator-initiated user program will remain. This program in the future will replace small projects that increasingly can be accomplished without the involvement of JGI, with imaginative large-scale 'Grand Challenge' projects of foundational relevance to energy and the environment that require a new scale of sequencing and analysis capabilities. Close interactions with the DOE Bioenergy Research Centers, and with other DOE institutions that may follow, will also play a major role in shaping aspects of how the JGI operates as a user facility. Based on increased availability of high-throughput sequencing, the JGI will increasingly provide to users, in addition to DNA sequencing, an array of both pre- and post-sequencing value-added capabilities to accelerate their science.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Graphs are widely used to represent bioentities such as proteins, genes, small molecules, ligands, and others such as nodes and their connections as edges within a network. In this review, special focus is given to the usability of bipartite graphs and their impact on the field of network biology and medicine. Furthermore, their topological properties and how these can be applied to certain biological case studies are discussed.

The first one was strain development at TGI by genetically engineering cyanobacteria to yield high levels of lipid and other specialty chemicals. The second component was developing an algal culture system at WSU to produce algal biomass as biofuel feedstock year-round in the northern states of the United States. This system included two cultivation modes, the first one was a phototrophic process and the second a heterotrophic process. The phototrophic process would be used for algae production in open ponds during warm seasons; the heterotrophic process would be used in cold seasons so that year-round production of algal lipid would be possible. In warm seasons the heterotrophic process would also produce algal seeds to be used in the phototrophic culture process. Selected strains of green algae and cyanobacteria developed by TGI were tested in the system. The third component was downstream algal biomass processing by Inventure that included efficiently harvesting the usable fuel fractions from the algae mass and effectively isolating and separating the usable components into specific fractions, and converting isolated fractions into green chemicals.","","","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Sustainable Transportation Office.

Over the last ten years, we have witnessed rapid advances in both microscopic and nucleic acid-based approaches to map genome architecture, and the application of these approaches to the dissection of higher-order chromosomal structures has yielded much new information. It is becoming increasingly clear, for example, that interphase chromosomes form stable, multilevel hierarchical structures. Among them, self-associating domains like so-called topologically associating domains (TADs) appear to be building blocks for large-scale genomic organization.

A phage display library of open reading frame (ORF) fragments was created from mRNA derived from different tissues. This was used to study the interaction network of the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, associated with many different pathologies. After two rounds of panning with TG2 we assayed the frequency of ORFs within the selected phage population using 454 sequencing. Ranking and analysis of more than 120 000 sequences allowed us to identify several potential interactors, which were subsequently confirmed in functional assays. Within the identified clones, three had been previously described as interacting proteins (fibronectin, SMOC1 and GSTO2), while all the others were new. When compared with standard systems, such as microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, the method described here is dramatically faster and yields far more information about the interaction under study, allowing better characterization of complex systems. For example, in the case of fibronectin, it was possible to identify the specific domains involved in the interaction.","Oxford University Press","","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Bazooka (Baz; PAR-3) localizes to the apical circumference of epithelial cells and is a key hub in the protein interaction network regulating epithelial structure. We sought to identify additional proteins that function with Baz to regulate epithelial structure in the Drosophila embryo. The baz zygotic mutant cuticle phenotype could be dominantly enhanced by loss of known interaction partners. To identify additional enhancers, we screened molecularly defined chromosome 2 and 3 deficiencies. 37 deficiencies acted as strong dominant enhancers. Using deficiency mapping, bioinformatics, and available single gene mutations, we identified 17 interacting genes encoding known and predicted polarity, cytoskeletal, transmembrane, trafficking and signaling proteins. For each gene, their loss of function enhanced adherens junction defects in zygotic baz mutants during early embryogenesis. To further evaluate involvement in epithelial polarity, we generated GFP fusion proteins for 15 of the genes which had not been found to localize to the apical domain previously. We found that GFP fusion proteins for Drosophila ASAP, Arf79F, CG11210, Septin 5 and Sds22 could be recruited to the apical circumference of epithelial cells. Nine of the other proteins showed various intracellular distributions, and one was not detected. Our enhancer screen identified 17 genes that function with Baz to regulate epithelial structure in the Drosophila embryo. Our secondary localization screen indicated that some of the proteins may affect epithelial cell polarity by acting at the apical cell cortex while others may act through intracellular processes. For 13 of the 17 genes, this is the first report of a link to baz or the regulation of epithelial structure.","Public Library of Science","","Univ. of Toronto, ON (Canada)","Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); University of Toronto","","United States","2010-04-01T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. e9938","","","MOP-82829","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0009938","","2022-11-08T05:00:00Z","1627403","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627403","","PLoS ONE","4","5"

These communities are often studied through metagenomic shotgun sequencing, but standard library construction methods remove long-range contiguity information; thus, shotgun sequencing and de novo assembly of a metagenome typically yield a collection of contigs that cannot readily be grouped by species. Methods for generating chromatin-level contact probability maps, e.g., as generated by the Hi-C method, provide a signal of contiguity that is completely intracellular and contains both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal information. Here, we demonstrate how this signal can be exploited to reconstruct the individual genomes of microbial species present within a mixed sample. We apply this approach to two synthetic metagenome samples, successfully clustering the genome content of fungal, bacterial, and archaeal species with more than 99% agreement with published reference genomes. We also show that the Hi-C signal can secondarily be used to create scaffolded genome assemblies of individual eukaryotic species present within the microbial community, with higher levels of contiguity than some of the species’ published reference genomes.","Genetics Society of America","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

In addition, it is well established that altered ROS levels are observed in multiple age-related illnesses including carcinogenesis, neurodegenerative, fatty liver, insulin resistance, and cardiac disease, to name just a few. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the primary mitochondrial ROS scavenging enzyme that converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently converted to water by catalase and other peroxidases. It has recently been shown that MnSOD enzymatic activity is regulated by the reversible acetylation of specific, evolutionarily conserved lysine(s) in the protein. These results, suggest for the first time, that the mitochondria contain bidirectional post-translational signaling networks, similar to that observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and that changes in lysine acetylation alter MnSOD enzymatic activity. In addition, these new results demonstrate that the mitochondrial anti-aging or fidelity / sensing protein, SIRT3, responds to changes in mitochondrial nutrient and/or redox status to alter the enzymatic activity of specific downstream targets, including MnSOD that adjusts and/or maintains ROS levels as well as metabolic homeostatic poise.","Impact Journals","","Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli during recovery from inorganic or organic mercury exposure","LaVoie, Stephen P.; Summers, Anne O.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Longitudinal RNA-Seq; Transcriptomics; Toxic metals; Essential metals; Stress response; Biofilm; Phenylmercury; Antibiotic resistance","Background: The protean chemical properties of mercury have long made it attractive for diverse applications, but its toxicity requires great care in its use, disposal, and recycling. Mercury occurs in multiple chemical forms, and the molecular basis for the distinct toxicity of its various forms is only partly understood. Global transcriptomics applied over time can reveal how a cell recognizes a toxicant and what cellular subsystems it marshals to repair and recover from the damage. The longitudinal effects on the transcriptome of exponential phase E. coli were compared during sub-acute exposure to mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) or to phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) using RNA-Seq. Results: Differential gene expression revealed common and distinct responses to the mercurials throughout recovery. Cultures exhibited growth stasis immediately after each mercurial exposure but returned to normal growth more quickly after PMA exposure than after HgCl<sub>2</sub> exposure. Correspondingly, PMA rapidly elicited up-regulation of a large number of genes which continued for 30 min, whereas fewer genes were up-regulated early after HgCl<sub>2</sub> exposure only some of which overlapped with PMA up-regulated genes. By 60 min gene expression in PMA-exposed cells was almost indistinguishable from unexposed cells, but HgCl<sub>2</sub> exposed cells still had many differentially expressed genes. Relative expression of energy production and most metabolite uptake pathways declined with both compounds, but nearly all stress response systems were up-regulated by one or the other mercurial during recovery. Conclusions: Sub-acute exposure influenced expression of ~45% of all genes with many distinct responses for each compound, reflecting differential biochemical damage by each mercurial and the corresponding resources available for repair. This study is the first global, high-resolution view of the transcriptional responses to any common toxicant in a prokaryotic model system from exposure to recovery of active growth. The responses provoked by these two mercurials in this model bacterium also provide insights about how higher organisms may respond to these ubiquitous metal toxicants.","Springer","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-01-16T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Genomics; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 52","","","FG02-07ER64408; ER64408; ER65286","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2164","10.1186/s12864-017-4413-z","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1618556","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1618556","","BMC Genomics","1","19"
"Autophagic degradation of the 26S proteasome is mediated by the dual ATG8/ubiquitin receptor RPN10 in <i>Arabidopsis<\/i>","Marshall, Richard S.; Li, Faqiang; Gemperline, David C.; Book, Adam J.; Vierstra, Richard D.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Autophagic turnover of intracellular constituents is critical for cellular housekeeping, nutrient recycling, and various aspects of growth and development in eukaryotes. In this paper, we show that autophagy impacts the other major degradative route involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system by eliminating 26S proteasomes, a process we termed proteaphagy. Using <i>Arabidopsis</i> proteasomes tagged with GFP, we observed their deposition into vacuoles via a route requiring components of the autophagy machinery. This transport can be initiated separately by nitrogen starvation and chemical or genetic inhibition of the proteasome, implying distinct induction mechanisms. Proteasome inhibition stimulates comprehensive ubiquitylation of the complex, with the ensuing proteaphagy requiring the proteasome subunit RPN10, which can simultaneously bind both ATG8 and ubiquitin. Finally and collectively, we propose that <i>Arabidopsis</i> RPN10 acts as a selective autophagy receptor that targets inactive 26S proteasomes by concurrent interactions with ubiquitylated proteasome subunits/targets and lipidated ATG8 lining the enveloping autophagic membranes.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2015-05-21T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Molecular Cell; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1053-1066","","","FG02-88ER13968","Journal ID: ISSN 1097-2765; PII: S1097276515003056","10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.023","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1259320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1259320","","Molecular Cell","6","58"
"Heterochromatic Genome Stability Requires Regulators of Histone H3 K9 Methylation","Peng, Jamy C.; Karpen, Gary H.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Genetics & Heredity","Heterochromatin contains many repetitive DNA elements and few protein-encoding genes, yet it is essential for chromosome organization and inheritance. Here, we show that Drosophila that lack the Su(var)3-9 H3K9 methyltransferase display significantly elevated frequencies of spontaneous DNA damage in heterochromatin, in both somatic and germ-line cells. Accumulated DNA damage in these mutants correlates with chromosomal defects, such as translocations and loss of heterozygosity. DNA repair and mitotic checkpoints are also activated in mutant animals and are required for their viability. Similar effects of lower magnitude were observed in animals that lack the RNA interference pathway component Dcr2. These results suggest that the H3K9 methylation and RNAi pathways ensure heterochromatin stability.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

Here we present the 87.7-Mbp haploid Porphyra genome (65.8% G + C content, 13,125 gene loci) and elucidate traits that inform our understanding of the biology of red algae as one of the few multicellular eukaryotic lineages. Novel features of the Porphyra genome shared by other red algae relate to the cytoskeleton, calcium signaling, the cell cycle, and stress-tolerance mechanisms including photoprotection. Cytoskeletal motor proteins in Porphyra are restricted to a small set of kinesins that appear to be the only universal cytoskeletal motors within the red algae. Dynein motors are absent, and most red algae, including Porphyra, lack myosin. This surprisingly minimal cytoskeleton offers a potential explanation for why red algal cells and multicellular structures are more limited in size than in most multicellular lineages. Additional discoveries further relating to the stress tolerance of bangiophytes include ancestral enzymes for sulfation of the hydrophilic galactan-rich cell wall, evidence for mannan synthesis that originated before the divergence of green and red algae, and a high capacity for nutrient uptake. Our analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the red algae, which are both commercially important and have played a major role in the evolution of other algal groups through secondary endosymbioses.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2017-07-17T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: 31","","Medium: ED; Size: p.

Expressed Sequence Tag (EST)sequencing is the method of choice for recovering cDNAs representing a majority of the transcripts encoded in a eukaryotic genome. However, EST sequencing samples a library at random, so it realizes diminishing returns as the project progresses. To drive cDNA collections toward completion new methods are needed to recover cDNAs representing specific genes and alternative transcripts, including transcripts with low expression levels. We describe a simple and effective inverse-PCR-based method for screening plasmid libraries to recover intact cDNAs for specific transcripts. We tested the method by screening libraries used in our Drosophila EST projects for 153 transcription factor genes that were not yet represented by full-length cDNAs. We recovered target-specific clones for 104 of the genes: 46 exactly match, 30 improve and 28partially match current gene annotations. Successful application of the screening method depends on cDNA library complexity and quality of the gene models. The approach should be effective for improving cDNA collections for other model organisms and the human. It also provides a simple and rapid method for isolating cDNAs of interest in any system for which plasmid cDNA libraries and complete or partial gene sequences are available.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Although a number of effectors are known in metazoans and fungi, none of these are predicted to exist in their canonical forms in plants. To identify ab initio plant G-protein effectors and scaffold proteins, we screened a set of proteins from the G-protein complex using two-hybrid complementation in yeast. After deep and exhaustive interrogation, we detected 544 interactions between 434 proteins, of which 68 highly interconnected proteins form the core G-protein interactome. Within this core, over half of the interactions comprising two-thirds of the nodes were retested and validated as genuine in planta. Co-expression analysis in combination with phenotyping of loss-of-function mutations in a set of core interactome genes revealed a novel role for G-proteins in regulating cell wall modification.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

BMCs have crucial roles in carbon dioxide fixation in autotrophs and the catabolism of organic substrates in heterotrophs. They contribute to the metabolic versatility of bacteria, providing a competitive advantage in specific environmental niches. Although BMCs were first visualized more than 60 years ago, it is mainly in the past decade that progress has been made in understanding their metabolic diversity and the structural basis of their assembly and function. This progress has not only heightened our understanding of their role in microbial metabolism but is also beginning to enable their use in a variety of applications in synthetic biology.

Stringent regulation of the distribution and quantity of meiotic crossovers is critical for proper chromosome segregation in many organisms. In humans, aberrant crossover placement and the failure to faithfully segregate meiotic chromosomes often results in severe genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome. In most sexually reproducing organisms, crossovers are more evenly spaced than would be expected from a random distribution. This phenomenon, termed interference, was first reported in the early 20th century by Drosophila geneticists and has been subsequently observed in a vast range of organisms from yeasts to humans. Yet, many questions regarding the behavior and mechanism of interference remain poorly understood. In this review, we examine results new and old, from a wide range of organisms, to begin to understand the progress and remaining challenges to understanding the fundamental unanswered questions regarding genetic interference.","Bentham Science Publishers","","University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

The YAC has been further engineered to insert LoxP sites flanking a 35 kb long, distant downstream regulatory region (DRR) containing previously described DNaseI hypersensitive sites, to allow direct comparison between the presence or absence of this region in the same genomic context. Five independent transgenic lines were obtained that vary in the extent of downstream PAX6 locus that has integrated. Analysis of transgenic embryos carrying full-length and truncated versions of the YAC indicates the location and putative function of several novel tissue-specific enhancers. Absence of these distal regulatory elements abolishes expression in specific tissues despite the presence of more proximal enhancers with overlapping specificity, strongly suggesting interaction between these control elements. Using plasmid-based reporter transgenic analysis we provide detailed characterization of one of these enhancers in isolation. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of a short PAX6 isoform derived from an internal promoter in a multicopy YAC transgenic line results in a microphthalmia phenotype. Finally, direct comparison of a single-copy line with the floxed DRR before and after Cre-mediated deletion demonstrates unequivocally the essential role of these long-range control elements for PAX6 expression.","Elsevier","","Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland (United Kingdom)","European Union (EU)","","United States","2006-08-30T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Developmental Biology; Journal Volume: 299; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: p. 563-581","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0012-1606; PII: S0012160606011523","10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.08.060","","2022-08-29T04:00:00Z","1623725","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1623725","","Developmental Biology","2","299"

The complete 5-Mb genome of S. oneidensis MR1 was sequenced and standard sequence-comparison methods revealed approximately 42% of the MR-1 genome encodes proteins of unknown function. Defining the functions of hypothetical proteins is a great challenge and may need a systems approach. In this study, by using integrated approaches including whole genomic microarray and proteomics, we examined knockout effects of the gene encoding SO1377 (gi24372955), a member of the conserved, hypothetical, bacterial protein family COG2268 (Clusters of Orthologous Group) in bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, under various physiological conditions. Compared with the wild-type strain, growth assays showed that the deletion mutant had a decreased growth rate when cultured aerobically, but not affected under anaerobic conditions. Whole-genome expression (RNA and protein) profiles revealed numerous gene and protein expression changes relative to the wild-type control, including some involved in iron metabolism, oxidative damage protection and respiratory electron transfer, e. g. complex IV of the respiration chain. Although total intracellular iron levels remained unchanged, whole-cell electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) demonstrated that the level of free iron in mutant cells was 3 times less than that of the wild-type strain. Siderophore excretion in the mutant also decreased in iron-depleted medium. The mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and gave rise to 100 times more colonies resistant to gentamicin or kanamycin. Our results showed that the knock-out of SO1377 gene had pleiotropic effects and suggested that SO1377 may play a role in iron homeostasis and oxidative damage protection in S. oneidensis MR-1.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Here we map in vitro and in-cell phosphorylation sites across FUS LC. We show that both phosphorylation and phosphomimetic variants reduce its aggregation-prone/prion-like character, disrupting FUS phase separation in the presence of RNA or salt and reducing FUS propensity to aggregate. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates the intrinsically disordered structure of FUS LC is preserved after phosphorylation; however, transient domain collapse and self-interaction are reduced by phosphomimetics. Moreover, we show that phosphomimetic FUS reduces aggregation in human and yeast cell models, and can ameliorate FUS-associated cytotoxicity. Hence, post-translational modification may be a mechanism by which cells control physiological assembly and prevent pathological protein aggregation, suggesting a potential treatment pathway amenable to pharmacologic modulation.","","","Lehigh Univ., Bethlehem, PA (United States); Brown Univ., Providence, RI (United States); Uniformed Services Univ., Bethesda, MD (United States); Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD (United States); National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

The global carbon cycle plays a central role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) levels and thus Earth's climate, but our basic understanding of the myriad of tightly interlinked biological processes that drive the global carbon cycle remains limited at best. Whether terrestrial and ocean ecosystems will capture, store, or release carbon is highly dependent on how changing climate conditions affect processes performed by the organisms that form Earth's biosphere. Advancing our knowledge of biological components of the global carbon cycle is thus crucial to predicting potential climate change impacts, assessing the viability of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, and informing relevant policy decisions. Global carbon cycling is dominated by the paired biological processes of photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic plants and microbes of Earth's land-masses and oceans use solar energy to transform atmospheric CO{sub 2} into organic carbon. The majority of this organic carbon is rapidly consumed by plants or microbial decomposers for respiration and returned to the atmosphere as CO{sub 2}. Coupling between the two processes results in a near equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration at the global scale, but some fraction of organic carbon also remains in stabilized forms such as biomass, soil, and deep ocean sediments. This process, known as carbon biosequestration, temporarily removes carbon from active cycling and has thus far absorbed a substantial fraction of anthropogenic carbon emissions.","","","DOESC (USDOE Office of Science (SC))","USDOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research","","United States","2008-12-01T05:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED","","DOE/SC-108","","TRN: US200907%%102","10.2172/948438","","2021-07-28T04:00:00Z","948438","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/948438","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/948438","","",""

To study aptamer function and dynamics, the malachite green aptamer was chosen as a model. Malachite green (MG) bleaching, in which an OH- attacks the central carbon (C1) of MG, was inhibited in the presence of the malachite green aptamer (MGA). The inhibition of MG bleaching by MGA could be reversed by an antisense oligonucleotide (AS) complementary to the MGA binding pocket. Computational cavity analysis of the NMR structure of the MGA-MG complex predicted that the OH<sup>-</sup> is sterically excluded from the C1 of MG. The prediction was confirmed experimentally using variants of the MGA with changes in the MG binding pocket. This work shows that molecular reactivity can be reversibly regulated by an aptamer-AS pair based on steric hindrance. In addition to demonstrate that aptamers could control molecular reactivity, aptamer dynamics was studied with a strategy combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental verification. MD simulation predicted that the MG binding pocket of the MGA is largely pre-organized and that binding of MG involves reorganization of the pocket and a simultaneous twisting of the MGA terminal stems around the pocket. MD simulation also provided a 3D-structure model of unoccupied MGA that has not yet been obtained by biophysical measurements. These predictions were consistent with biochemical and biophysical measurements of the MGA-MG interaction including RNase I footprinting, melting curves, thermodynamic and kinetic constants measurement. This work shows that MD simulation can be used to extend our understanding of the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction which is not evident from static 3D-structures. To conclude, I have developed a novel concept to control molecular reactivity by an aptamer based on steric protection and a strategy to study the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction by combining MD simulation and experimental verification. The former has potential application in controlling metabolic reactions and protein modifications by small reactants and the latter may serve as a general approach to study the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction for new insights into mechanisms of aptamer-target recognition.","","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2008-01-01T05:00:00Z","English","Thesis/Dissertation","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 156 p.","","IS-T 2769","AC02-07CH11358; W-7405-Eng-82","TRN: US200921%%151","10.2172/964604","","2016-08-23T04:00:00Z","964604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/964604","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/964604","","",""

The essential role of aerobic metabolism, the generation and consumption of ATP and other high energy phosphates, sustains a balance of approximately 3000 essential human metabolites that serve not only as nutrients, but also as antioxidants, neurotransmitters, osmolytes, and participants in ligand-based and other cellular signaling. In hypoxia, ischemia, and oxidative stress, where pathological circumstances cause oxygen radicals to form at a rate greater than is possible for their consumption, changes in the composition of metabolite ensembles, or metabolomes, can be associated with physiological changes. Metabolomics and metabonomics are a scientific disciplines that focuse on quantifying dynamic metabolome responses, using multivariate analytical approaches derived from methods within genomics, a discipline that consolidated innovative analysis techniques for situations where the number of biomarkers (metabolites in our case) greatly exceeds the number of subjects. This review focuses on the behavior of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and redox metabolites in ameliorating or exacerbating oxidative stress. After reviewing work regarding a small number of metabolites—pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate—whose exogenous administration was found to ameliorate oxidative stress, a subsequent section reviews basic multivariate statistical methods common in metabolomics research, and their application in human and preclinical studies emphasizing oxidative stress. Particular attention is paid to new NMR spectroscopy methods in metabolomics and metabonomics. Because complex relationships connect oxidative stress to so many physiological processes, studies from different disciplines were reviewed. All, however, shared the common goal of ultimately developing “omics”-based, diagnostic tests to help influence therapies.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

In budding yeast, five mitotic septins (Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1), which are essential for cytokinesis, transition during bud growth from a patch to a collar, which splits into two rings in cytokinesis and is disassembled before the next cell cycle. Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, and Cdc12 form an apolar octameric rod with Cdc11 at each tip, which polymerizes into straight paired filaments. We show that Shs1 substitutes for Cdc11, resulting in octameric rods that do not polymerize into filaments but associate laterally, forming curved bundles that close into rings. In vivo, half of shs1Δ mutant cells exhibit incomplete collars and disrupted neck filaments. Importantly, different phosphomimetic mutations in Shs1 can either prevent ring formation or promote formation of a gauzelike meshwork. These results show that a single alternative terminal subunit is sufficient to confer a distinctive higher-order septin ultrastructure that can be further regulated by phosphorylation.","Rockefeller University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

We determined and documented embryonic expression patterns for 6,003 (44%) of the 13,659 protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome with over 70,000 images and controlled vocabulary annotations. Individual expression patterns are extraordinarily diverse, but by supplementing qualitative in situ hybridization data with quantitative microarray time-course data using a hybrid clustering strategy, we identify groups of genes with similar expression. Of 4,496 genes with detectable expression in the embryo, 2,549 (57%) fall into 10 clusters representing broad expression patterns. The remaining 1,947 (43%) genes fall into 29 clusters representing restricted expression, 20% patterned as early as blastoderm, with the majority restricted to differentiated cell types, such as epithelia, nervous system, or muscle. We investigate the relationship between expression clusters and known molecular and cellular physiological functions. Nearly 60% of the genes with detectable expression exhibit broad patterns reflecting quantitative rather than qualitative differences between tissues. The other 40% show tissue restricted expression; the expression patterns of over 1,500 of these genes are documented here for the first time.

This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3' end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo.

"Protein Modularity of Alternatively Spliced Exons Is Associated with Tissue-Specific Regulation of Alternative Splicing","Xing, Yi; Lee, Christopher J.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Genetics & Heredity","Recent comparative genomic analysis of alternative splicing has shown that protein modularity is an important criterion for functional alternative splicing events. Exons that are alternatively spliced in multiple organisms are much more likely to be an exact multiple of 3 nt in length, representing a class of ‘‘modular’’ exons that can be inserted or removed from the transcripts without affecting the rest of the protein. To understand the precise roles of these modular exons, in this paper we have analyzed microarray data for 3,126 alternatively spliced exons across ten mouse tissues generated by Pan and coworkers. We show that modular exons are strongly associated with tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing. Exons that are alternatively spliced at uniformly high transcript inclusion levels or uniformly low levels show no preference for protein modularity. In contrast, alternatively spliced exons with dramatic changes of inclusion levels across mouse tissues (referred to as ‘‘tissue-switched’’ exons) are both strikingly biased to be modular and are strongly conserved between human and mouse. The analysis of different subsets of tissue switched exons shows that the increased protein modularity cannot be explained by the overall exon inclusion level, but is specifically associated with tissue-switched alternative splicing.","Public Library of Science","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"When evolution is the solution to pollution: Key principles, and lessons from rapid repeated adaptation of killifish (<em>Fundulus heteroclitus<\/em>) populations","Whitehead, Andrew; Clark, Bryan W.; Reid, Noah M.; Hahn, Mark E.; Nacci, Diane","Evolutionary Biology; adaptation; contemporary evolution; ecological genetics; ecotoxicology; genomics/proteomics; molecular evolution; natural selection and contemporary evolution; population genetics—empirical","For most species, evolutionary adaptation is not expected to be sufficiently rapid to buffer the effects of human-mediated environmental changes, including environmental pollution. Here we review how key features of populations, the characteristics of environmental pollution, and the genetic architecture underlying adaptive traits, may interact to shape the likelihood of evolutionary rescue from pollution. Large populations of Atlantic killifish (<em>Fundulus heteroclitus</em>) persist in some of the most contaminated estuaries of the United States, and killifish studies have provided some of the first insights into the types of genomic changes that enable rapid evolutionary rescue from complexly degraded environments. We describe how selection by industrial pollutants and other stressors has acted on multiple populations of killifish and posit that extreme nucleotide diversity uniquely positions this species for successful evolutionary adaptation. Mechanistic studies have identified some of the genetic underpinnings of adaptation to a well-studied class of toxic pollutants; however, multiple genetic regions under selection in wild populations seem to reflect more complex responses to diverse native stressors and/or compensatory responses to primary adaptation. The discovery of these pollution-adapted killifish populations suggests that the evolutionary influence of anthropogenic stressors as selective agents occurs widely. Yet adaptation to chemical pollution in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate wildlife may rarely be a successful “solution to pollution” because potentially adaptive phenotypes may be complex and incur fitness costs, and therefore be unlikely to evolve quickly enough, especially in species with small population sizes.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-02-17T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Evolutionary Applications; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 762-783","","","SC0014664","Journal ID: ISSN 1752-4571","10.1111/eva.12470","","2023-07-03T04:00:00Z","1353288","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1353288","","Evolutionary Applications","8","10"

Three key features make Escher a uniquely effective tool for pathway visualization. First, users can rapidly design new pathway maps. Escher provides pathway suggestions based on user data and genome-scale models, so users can draw pathways in a semi-automated way. Second, users can visualize data related to genes or proteins on the associated reactions and pathways, using rules that define which enzymes catalyze each reaction. Thus, users can identify trends in common genomic data types (e.g. RNA-Seq, proteomics, ChIP)—in conjunction with metabolite- and reaction-oriented data types (e.g. metabolomics, fluxomics). Third, Escher harnesses the strengths of web technologies (SVG, D3, developer tools) so that visualizations can be rapidly adapted, extended, shared, and embedded. This paper provides examples of each of these features and explains how the development approach used for Escher can be used to guide the development of future visualization tools.","Public Library of Science","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States); Univ. of Tubingen (Germany); Technical Univ. of Denmark, Lyngby (Denmark)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Inst. of Health (NIH) (United States); European Commission (EC); Novo Nordisk Foundation (Denmark)","","United States","2015-08-27T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS Computational Biology (Online); Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e1004321","","","SC0008701; DGE-1144086; R21 HD080682; 332020; NNF 132150-002","Journal ID: ISSN 1553-7358","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004321","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1455068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1455068","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1455068","PLoS Computational Biology (Online)","8","11"

Their interactions are significant drivers of many ecosystem functions and are important for the health of plants and animals. A large number of fungal and bacterial families engage in complex interactions that lead to critical behavioural shifts of the microorganisms ranging from mutualism to antagonism. The importance of bacterial–fungal interactions (BFI) in environmental science, medicine and biotechnology has led to the emergence of a dynamic and multidisciplinary research field that combines highly diverse approaches including molecular biology, genomics, geochemistry, chemical and microbial ecology, biophysics and ecological modelling. In this review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the roles of BFI across relevant habitats and ecosystems. A particular focus is placed on the understanding of BFI within complex microbial communities and in regard of the metaorganism concept. We also discuss recent discoveries that clarify the (molecular) mechanisms involved in bacterial–fungal relationships, and the contribution of new technologies to decipher generic principles of BFI in terms of physical associations and molecular dialogues. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in order to stimulate synergy within the BFI research area and to resolve outstanding questions.","Federation of European Microbiological Societies","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2018-02-19T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: FEMS Microbiology Reviews; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 335-352","","","AC05-00OR22725","Journal ID: ISSN 1574-6976","10.1093/femsre/fuy008","","2024-11-22T05:00:00Z","1468277","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1468277","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1468277","FEMS Microbiology Reviews","3","42"

The vision and scope of the Genomics:GTL program continue to expand and encompass research and technology issues from diverse scientific disciplines, attracting broad interest and support from researchers at universities, DOE national laboratories, and industry. Metabolic engineering's vision is the targeted and purposeful alteration of metabolic pathways to improve the understanding and use of cellular pathways for chemical transformation, energy transduction, and supramolecular assembly. These two programs have much complementarity in both vision and technological approaches, as reflected in this joint workshop. GLT's challenge to the scientific community remains the further development and use of a broad array of innovative technologies and computational tools to systematically leverage the knowledge and capabilities brought to us by DNA sequencing projects. The goal is to seek a broad and predictive understanding of the functioning and control of complex systems--individual microbes, microbial communities, and plants. GTL's prominent position at the interface of the physical, computational, and biological sciences is both a strength and challenge. Microbes remain GTL's principal biological focus. In the complex 'simplicity' of microbes, they find capabilities needed by DOE and the nation for clean and secure energy, cleanup of environmental contamination, and sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. An ongoing challenge for the entire GTL community is to demonstrate that the fundamental science conducted in each of your research projects brings us a step closer to biology-based solutions for these important national energy and environmental needs.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here we show how the need to minimize the waste of resources to non-functional interactions limits the proteome diversity and the average concentration of co-expressed and co-localized proteins. Using the results of high-throughput Yeast 2-Hybrid experiments, we estimate the characteristic strength of non-functional protein–protein interactions. By combining these data with the strengths of specific interactions, we assess the fraction of time proteins spend tied up in non-functional interactions as a function of their overall concentration. This allows us to sketch the phase diagram for baker’s yeast cells using the experimentally measured concentrations and subcellular localization of their proteins. The positions of yeast compartments on the phase diagram are consistent with our hypothesis that the yeast proteome has evolved to operate closely to the upper limit of its size, whereas keeping individual protein concentrations sufficiently low to reduce non-functional interactions. These findings have implication for conceptual understanding of intracellular compartmentalization, multicellularity and differentiation.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

In addition, it is well established that aberrations in mitochondrial metabolism, as measured by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), are observed in both aging and cancer. In this regard, genes that impact upon longevity have recently been characterized in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, and the human homologs include the Sirtuin family of protein deacetylases. Interestingly, three of the seven sirtuin proteins are localized into the mitochondria suggesting a connection between the mitochondrial sirtuins, the free radical theory of aging, and carcinogenesis. Based on these results it has been hypothesized that Sirt3 functions as a mitochondrial fidelity protein whose function governs both aging and carcinogenesis by modulating ROS metabolism. Sirt3 has also now been identified as a genomically expressed, mitochondrial localized tumor suppressor and this review will outline potential relationships between mitochondrial ROS/superoxide levels, aging, and cell phenotypes permissive for estrogen and progesterone receptor positive breast carcinogenesis.","MDPI","","Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"The WD40 protein Caf4p is a component of the mitochondrial fission machinery and recruits Dnm1p to mitochondria","Griffin, Erik E.; Graumann, Johannes; Chan, David C.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Cell Biology","The mitochondrial division machinery regulates mitochondrial dynamics and consists of Fis1p, Mdv1p, and Dnm1p. Mitochondrial division relies on the recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Dnm1p to mitochondria. Dnm1p recruitment depends on the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Fis1p. Mdv1p interacts with Fis1p and Dnm1p, but is thought to act at a late step during fission because Mdv1p is dispensable for Dnm1p localization. We identify the WD40 repeat protein Caf4p as a Fis1p-associated protein that localizes to mitochondria in a Fis1p-dependent manner. Caf4p interacts with each component of the fission apparatus: with Fis1p and Mdv1p through its NH2-terminal half and with Dnm1p through its COOH-terminal WD40 domain. We demonstrate that mdv1Δ yeast contain residual mitochondrial fission due to the redundant activity of Caf4p. Moreover, recruitment of Dnm1p to mitochondria is disrupted in mdv1Δ caf4Δ yeast, demonstrating that Mdv1p and Caf4p are molecular adaptors that recruit Dnm1p to mitochondrial fission sites. Our studies support a revised model for assembly of the mitochondrial fission apparatus.","Rockefeller University Press","","California Institute of Technology (CalTech), Pasadena, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Isolated examples of polycistronic RNAs were also reported in some higher eukaryotes but their presence was generally considered rare. Here we developed a longread sequencing strategy to identify polycistronic transcripts in several mushroom forming fungal species including Plicaturopsis crispa, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, and Gloeophyllum trabeum. We found genome-wide prevalence of polycistronic transcription in these Agaricomycetes, involving up to 8% of the transcribed genes. Unlike polycistronic mRNAs in prokaryotes, these co-transcribed genes are also independently transcribed. We show that polycistronic transcription may interfere with expression of the downstream tandem gene. Further comparative genomic analysis indicates that polycistronic transcription is conserved among a wide range of mushroom forming fungi. In summary, our study revealed, for the first time, the genome prevalence of polycistronic transcription in a phylogenetic range of higher fungi. Furthermore, we systematically show that our long-read sequencing approach and combined bioinformatics pipeline is a generic powerful tool for precise characterization of complex transcriptomes that enables identification of mRNA isoforms not recovered via short-read assembly.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2015-07-15T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e0132628","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0132628","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1627758","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627758","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627758","PLoS ONE","7","10"

The high-level goal of TMTI is to accelerate the development of broad-spectrum countermeasures. To achieve those goals, TMTI has a near term need to obtain more sequence information across a large range of pathogens, near neighbors, and across a broad geographical and host range. Our role in this project is to research available sequence data for the organisms of interest and identify critical microbial sequence and knowledge gaps that need to be filled to meet TMTI objectives. This effort includes: (1) assessing current genomic sequence for each agent including phylogenetic and geographical diversity, host range, date of isolation range, virulence, sequence availability of key near neighbors, and other characteristics; (2) identifying Subject Matter Experts (SME's) and potential holders of isolate collections, contacting appropriate SME's with known expertise and isolate collections to obtain information on isolate availability and specific recommendations; (3) identifying sequence as well as knowledge gaps (eg virulence, host range, and antibiotic resistance determinants); (4) providing specific recommendations as to the most valuable strains to be placed on the DTRA sequencing queue. We acknowledge that criteria for prioritization of isolates for sequencing falls into two categories aligning with priority queues 1 and 2 as described in the summary. (Priority queue 0 relates to DTRA operational isolates whose availability is not predictable in advance.) 1. Selection of isolates that appear to have likelihood to provide information on virulence and antibiotic resistance. This will include sequence of known virulent strains. Particularly valuable would be virulent strains that have genetically similar yet avirulent, or non human transmissible, counterparts that can be used for comparison to help identify key virulence or host range genes. This approach will provide information that can be used by structural biologists to help develop therapeutics and vaccines. We have pointed out such high priority strains of which we are aware, and note that if any such isolates should be discovered, they will rise to the top priority. We anticipate difficulty locating samples with unusual resistance phenotypes, in particular. Sequencing strategies for isolates in queue 1 should aim for as complete finishing status as possible, since high-quality initial annotation (gene-calling) will be necessary for the follow-on protein structure analyses contributing to countermeasure development. Queue 2 for sequencing determination will be more dynamic than queue 1, and samples will be added to it as they become available to the TMTI program. 2. Selection of isolates that will provide broader information about diversity and phylogenetics and aid in specific detection as well as forensics. This approach focuses on sequencing of isolates that will provide better resolution of variants that are (or were) circulating in nature. The finishing strategy for queue 2 does not require complete closing with annotation. This queue is more static, as there is considerable phylogenetic data, and in this report we have sought to reveal gaps and make suggestions to fill them given existing sequence data and strain information. In this report we identify current sequencing gaps in both priority queue categories. Note that this is most applicable to the bacterial pathogens, as most viruses are by default in queue 1. The Phase I focus of this project is on viral hemorrhagic fever viruses and Category A bacterial agents as defined to us by TMTI.

As a result, it is difficult to assess the performance of orthology inference methods. Here, we present a community effort to establish standards and an automated web-based service to facilitate orthology benchmarking. Using this service, we characterize 15 well-established inference methods and resources on a battery of 20 different benchmarks. Standardized benchmarking provides a way for users to identify the most effective methods for the problem at hand, sets a minimum requirement for new tools and resources, and guides the development of more accurate orthology inference methods.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation of Spain (MINECO); Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF); European Research Council (ERC); National Institutes of Health (NIH); State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI); National Science Foundation (NSF); European Molecular Biology Laboratory; Wellcome Trust; Novo Nordisk Foundation; La Caixa–CRG International Fellowship Program","Quest for Orthologs Consortium","United States","2016-04-04T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Methods; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 425-430","","","AC02-05CH11231; PP00P3_150654; BB/L018241/1; BIO2012-37161; NPRP 5-298-3-086; ERC-2012-StG-310325; R24 OD011883; U41 HG002273; U41 HG007822; 1355632; NNF14CC0001","Journal ID: ISSN 1548-7091; PII: BFnmeth3830","10.1038/nmeth.3830","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1624013","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1624013","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1624013","Nature Methods","5","13"

"Comparing sequences without using alignments: application to HIV/SIV subtyping","Didier, Gilles; Debomy, Laurent; Pupin, Maude; Zhang, Ming; Grossmann, Alexander; Devauchelle, Claudine; Laprevotte, Ivan","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology","Background: In general, the construction of trees is based on sequence alignments. This procedure, however, leads to loss of informationwhen parts of sequence alignments (for instance ambiguous regions) are deleted before tree building. To overcome this difficulty, one of us previously introduced a new and rapid algorithm that calculates dissimilarity matrices between sequences without preliminary alignment. Results: In this paper, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) sequence data are used to evaluate this method. The program produces tree topologies that are identical to those obtained by a combination of standard methods detailed in the HIV Sequence Compendium. Manual alignment editing is not necessary at any stage. Furthermore, only one userspecified parameter is needed for constructing trees. Conclusion: The extensive tests on HIV/SIV subtyping showed that the virus classifications produced by our method are in good agreement with our best taxonomic knowledge, even in noncoding LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) regions that are not tractable by regular alignment methods due to frequent duplications/insertions/deletions. Our method, however, is not limited to the HIV/ SIV subtyping. It provides an alternative tree construction without a time-consuming aligning procedure.","BioMed Central","","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"On the functions of the h subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 in late stages of translation initiation","Kim, Byung-Hoon; Cai, Xue; Vaughn, Justin N.; von Arnim, Albrecht G.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biotechnology & applied microbiology; genetics & heredity; translation initiation; additional data file; leader sequence; translation state; upstream open reading frame","Background: The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has multiple roles during the initiation of translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs. How individual subunits of eIF3 contribute to the translation of specific mRNAs remains poorly understood, however. This is true in particular for those subunits that are not conserved in budding yeast, such as eIF3h. Results: Working with stable reporter transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, it was demonstrated that the h subunit of eIF3 contributes to the efficient translation initiation of mRNAs harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5' leader sequence. uORFs, which can function as devices for translational regulation, are present in over 30% of Arabidopsis mRNAs, and are enriched among mRNAs for transcriptional regulators and protein modifying enzymes. Microarray comparisons of polysome loading in wild-type and eif3h mutant seedlings revealed that eIF3h generally helps to maintain efficient polysome loading of mRNAs harboring multiple uORFs. In addition, however, eIF3h also boosted the polysome loading of mRNAs with long leaders or coding sequences. Moreover, the relative polysome loading of certain functional groups of mRNAs, including ribosomal proteins, was actually increased in the eif3h mutant, suggesting that regulons of translational control can be revealed by mutations in generic translation initiation factors. Conclusion: The intact eIF3h protein contributes to efficient translation initiation on 5' leader sequences harboring multiple uORFs, although mRNA features independent of uORFs are also implicated.","BioMed Central","","Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Herein, our objective is to highlight the most recent developments in single cell manipulation, as well as pioneering ones. First, flow-through methods will be discussed, namely methods in which the single cells flow continuously in an ordered manner during their analysis. This section will be followed by confinement techniques that enable cell isolation and confinement in one, two- or three-dimensions. Flow cytometry and droplet microfluidics are the two most common methods of flow-through analysis. While both are high-throughput techniques, their difference lays in the fact that the droplet encapsulated cells experience a restricted and personal microenvironment, while in flow cytometry cells experience similar nutrient and stimuli initial concentrations. These methods are rather well established; however, they recently enabled immense strides in single cell phenotypic analysis, namely the identification and analysis of metabolically distinct individuals from an isogenic population using both droplet microfluidics and flow cytometry.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2014-10-31T04:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metabolic Engineering; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 115-135","","PNNL-SA-104442","AC05-76RL01830; SC0008744; PN12005/2406","Journal ID: ISSN 1096-7176","10.1016/j.ymben.2014.09.007","","2023-06-26T04:00:00Z","1184963","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1184963","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1184963","Metabolic Engineering","C","27"
"A subset of the diverse COG0523 family of putative metal chaperones is linked to zinc homeostasis in all kingdoms of life","Haas, Crysten E.; Rodionov, Dmitry A.; Kropat, Janette; Malasarn, Davin; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; de Crécy-Lagard, Valérie","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity","Background: COG0523 proteins are, like the nickel chaperones of the UreG family, part of the G3E family of GTPases linking them to metallocenter biosynthesis. Even though the first COG0523- encoding gene, cobW, was identified almost 20 years ago, little is known concerning the function of other members belonging to this ubiquitous family. Results: Based on a combination of comparative genomics, literature and phylogenetic analyses and experimental validations, the COG0523 family can be separated into at least fifteen subgroups. The CobW subgroup involved in cobalamin synthesis represents only one small sub-fraction of the family. Another, larger subgroup, is suggested to play a predominant role in the response to zinc limitation based on the presence of the corresponding COG0523-encoding genes downstream from putative Zur binding sites in many bacterial genomes. Zur binding sites in these genomes are also associated with candidate zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-dependent enzymes. Finally, the potential role of COG0523 in zinc homeostasis is not limited to Bacteria. We have predicted a link between COG0523 and regulation by zinc in Archaea and show that two COG0523 genes are induced upon zinc depletion in a eukaryotic reference organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for the pursuit by experimental methods of the specific role of COG0523 members in metal trafficking. Based on phylogeny and comparative genomics, both the metal specificity and the protein target(s) might vary from one COG0523 subgroup to another. Additionally, Zur-dependent expression of COG0523 and putative paralogs of zinc-dependent proteins may represent a mechanism for hierarchal zinc distribution and zinc sparing in the face of inadequate zinc nutrition","Springer","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Archaeal Genome Guardians Give Insights into Eukaryotic DNA Replication and Damage Response Proteins","Shin, David S.; Pratt, Ashley J.; Tainer, John A.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Microbiology","As the third domain of life, archaea, like the eukarya and bacteria, must have robust DNA replication and repair complexes to ensure genome fidelity. Archaea moreover display a breadth of unique habitats and characteristics, and structural biologists increasingly appreciate these features. As archaea include extremophiles that can withstand diverse environmental stresses, they provide fundamental systems for understanding enzymes and pathways critical to genome integrity and stress responses. Such archaeal extremophiles provide critical data on the periodic table for life as well as on the biochemical, geochemical, and physical limitations to adaptive strategies allowing organisms to thrive under environmental stress relevant to determining the boundaries for life as we know it. Specifically, archaeal enzyme structures have informed the architecture and mechanisms of key DNA repair proteins and complexes. With added abilities to temperature-trap flexible complexes and reveal core domains of transient and dynamic complexes, these structures provide insights into mechanisms of maintaining genome integrity despite extreme environmental stress. The DNA damage response protein structures noted in this review therefore inform the basis for genome integrity in the face of environmental stress, with implications for all domains of life as well as for biomanufacturing, astrobiology, and medicine.","Hindawi","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA (United States).

The program operates under the authority of DOE Order 413.2B, 'Laboratory Directed Research and Development' (April 19, 2006), which establishes DOE's requirements for the program while providing the Laboratory Director broad flexibility for program implementation. LDRD funds are obtained through a charge to all Laboratory programs. This report includes summaries for all ORNL LDRD research activities supported during FY 2007. The associated FY 2007 ORNL LDRD Self-Assessment (ORNL/PPA-2008/2) provides financial data and an internal evaluation of the program's management process. ORNL is a DOE multiprogram science, technology, and energy laboratory with distinctive capabilities in materials science and engineering, neutron science and technology, energy production and end-use technologies, biological and environmental science, and scientific computing. With these capabilities ORNL conducts basic and applied research and development (R&amp;D) to support DOE's overarching mission to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the United States and promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission. As a national resource, the Laboratory also applies its capabilities and skills to specific needs of other federal agencies and customers through the DOE Work for Others (WFO) program. Information about the Laboratory and its programs is available on the Internet at http://www.ornl.gov/. LDRD is a relatively small but vital DOE program that allows ORNL, as well as other DOE laboratories, to select a limited number of R&amp;D projects for the purpose of: (1) maintaining the scientific and technical vitality of the Laboratory; (2) enhancing the Laboratory's ability to address future DOE missions; (3) fostering creativity and stimulating exploration of forefront science and technology; (4) serving as a proving ground for new research; and (5) supporting high-risk, potentially high-value R&amp;D. Through LDRD the Laboratory is able to improve its distinctive capabilities and enhance its ability to conduct cutting-edge R&amp;D for its DOE and WFO sponsors. To meet the LDRD objectives and fulfill the particular needs of the Laboratory, ORNL has established a program with two components: the Director's R&amp;D Fund and the Seed Money Fund. As outlined in Table 1, these two funds are complementary. The Director's R&amp;D Fund develops new capabilities in support of the Laboratory initiatives, while the Seed Money Fund is open to all innovative ideas that have the potential for enhancing the Laboratory's core scientific and technical competencies. Provision for multiple routes of access to ORNL LDRD funds maximizes the likelihood that novel ideas with scientific and technological merit will be recognized and supported.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The accomplishments described in this annual report demonstrate the strong alignment of the LDRD portfolio with these missions and contribute to the Laboratory's success in meeting its goals. The LDRD budget of $91.5 million for fiscal year 2008 sponsored 176 projects. These projects were selected through an extensive peer-review process to ensure the highest scientific quality and mission relevance. Each year, the number of deserving proposals far exceeds the funding available, making the selection a tough one indeed. Our ongoing investments in LDRD have reaped long-term rewards for the Laboratory and the nation. Many Laboratory programs trace their roots to research thrusts that began several years ago under LDRD sponsorship. In addition, many LDRD projects contribute to more than one mission area, leveraging the Laboratory's multidisciplinary team approach to science and technology. Safeguarding the nation from terrorist activity and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will be an enduring mission of this Laboratory, for which LDRD will continue to play a vital role. The LDRD Program is a success story. Our projects continue to win national recognition for excellence through prestigious awards, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and patents granted. With its reputation for sponsoring innovative projects, the LDRD Program is also a major vehicle for attracting and retaining the best and the brightest technical staff and for establishing collaborations with universities, industry, and other scientific and research institutions. By keeping the Laboratory at the forefront of science and technology, the LDRD Program enables us to meet our mission challenges, especially those of our ever-evolving national security mission. The Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) annual report for fiscal year 2008 (FY08) provides a summary of LDRD-funded projects for the fiscal year and consists of two parts: A broad description of the LDRD Program, the LDRD portfolio-management process, program statistics for the year, and highlights of accomplishments for the year.

Here we report the results from the first large-scale community-based critical assessment of protein function annotation (CAFA) experiment. Fifty-four methods representing the state of the art for protein function prediction were evaluated on a target set of 866 proteins from 11 organisms. Two findings stand out: (i) today’s best protein function prediction algorithms substantially outperform widely used first-generation methods, with large gains on all types of targets; and (ii) although the top methods perform well enough to guide experiments, there is considerable need for improvement of currently available tools.","Nature Publishing Group","","Indiana Univ., Bloomington, IN (United States); Miami Univ., Oxford, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Assessing the gene space in draft genomes","Parra, Genis; Bradnam, Keith; Ning, Zemin; Keane, Thomas; Korf, Ian","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Genome sequencing projects have been initiated for a wide range of eukaryotes. A few projects have reached completion, but most exist as draft assemblies. As one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. To answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes (CEGs), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. From an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of CEGs mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used N50 length and x-fold coverage values.","Oxford University Press","","Univ. of California, Davis, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

SBE&S involves the use of computer modeling and simulation to solve mathematical formulations of physical models of engineered and natural systems. SBE&S today has reached a level of predictive capability that it now firmly complements the traditional pillars of theory and experimentation/observation. As a result, computer simulation is more pervasive today – and having more impact – than at any other time in human history. Many critical technologies, including those to develop new energy sources and to shift the cost-benefit factors in healthcare, are on the horizon that cannot be understood, developed, or utilized without simulation. A panel of experts reviewed and assessed the state of the art in SBE&S as well as levels of activity overseas in the broad thematic areas of life sciences and medicine, materials, and energy and sustainability; and in the crosscutting issues of next generation hardware and algorithms; software development; engineering simulations; validation, verification, and uncertainty quantification; multiscale modeling and simulation; and SBE&S education. The panel hosted a U.S. baseline workshop, conducted a bibliometric analysis, consulted numerous experts and reports, and visited 59 institutions and companies throughout East Asia and Western Europe to explore the active research projects in those institutions, the computational infrastructure used for the projects, the funding schemes that enable the research, the collaborative interactions among universities, national laboratories, and corporate research centers, and workforce needs and development for SBE&S.","","","World Technology Evaluation Center, Inc., Baltimore, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); USDOD","","United States","2013-07-30T04:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED; Size: 426 p.","","DOE-NSF-25820","AI02-07ER25820","","10.2172/1088842","","2025-04-11T04:00:00Z","1088842","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1088842","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1088842","","",""

Fiscal year 2009 saw a heightened focus by DOE and the nation on the need to develop new sources of energy. Argonne scientists are investigating many different sources of energy, including nuclear, solar, and biofuels, as well as ways to store, use, and transmit energy more safely, cleanly, and efficiently. DOE selected Argonne as the site for two new Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) - the Institute for Atom-Efficient Chemical Transformations and the Center for Electrical Energy Storage - and funded two other EFRCs to which Argonne is a major partner. The award of at least two of the EFRCs can be directly linked to early LDRD-funded efforts. LDRD has historically seeded important programs and facilities at the lab. Two of these facilities, the Advanced Photon Source and the Center for Nanoscale Materials, are now vital contributors to today's LDRD Program. New and enhanced capabilities, many of which relied on LDRD in their early stages, now help the laboratory pursue its evolving strategic goals. LDRD has, since its inception, been an invaluable resource for positioning the Laboratory to anticipate, and thus be prepared to contribute to, the future science and technology needs of DOE and the nation. During times of change, LDRD becomes all the more vital for facilitating the necessary adjustments while maintaining and enhancing the capabilities of our staff and facilities. Although I am new to the role of Laboratory Director, my immediate prior service as Deputy Laboratory Director for Programs afforded me continuous involvement in the LDRD program and its management. Therefore, I can attest that Argonne's program adhered closely to the requirements of DOE Order 413.2b and associated guidelines governing LDRD. Our LDRD program management continually strives to be more efficient. In addition to meeting all reporting requirements during fiscal year 2009, our LDRD Office continues to enhance its electronic systems to streamline the LDRD management process. You will see from the following individual project reports that Argonne's researchers have once again done a superb job pursuing projects at the forefront of their respective fields and have contributed significantly to the advancement of Argonne's strategic thrusts. This work has not only attracted follow-on sponsorship in many cases, but is also proving to be a valuable basis upon which to continue realignment of our strategic portfolio to better match the Laboratory's Strategic Plan.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"<strong>Fast Identification and Removal of Sequence Contamination from Genomic and Metagenomic Datasets<\/strong>","Schmieder, Robert; Edwards, Robert","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; sequence alignment; human genomics; metagenomics; sequence databases; web-based applications; BLAST algorithm; genomic databases; bacterial genomics","High-throughput sequencing technologies have strongly impacted microbiology, providing a rapid and cost-effective way of generating draft genomes and exploring microbial diversity. However, sequences obtained from impure nucleic acid preparations may contain DNA from sources other than the sample. Those sequence contaminations are a serious concern to the quality of the data used for downstream analysis, causing misassembly of sequence contigs and erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the removal of sequence contaminants is a necessary and required step for all sequencing projects. We developed DeconSeq, a robust framework for the rapid, automated identification and removal of sequence contamination in longer-read datasets (150 bp mean read length). DeconSeq is publicly available as standalone and web-based versions. The results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases used for the web-based version are automatically updated on a regular basis. DeconSeq categorizes possible contamination sequences, eliminates redundant hits with higher similarity to non-contaminant genomes, and provides graphical visualizations of the alignment results and classifications. Using DeconSeq, we conducted an analysis of possible human DNA contamination in 202 previously published microbial and viral metagenomes and found possible contamination in 145 (72%) metagenomes with as high as 64% contaminating sequences. This new framework allows scientists to automatically detect and efficiently remove unwanted sequence contamination from their datasets while eliminating critical limitations of current methods. DeconSeq’s web interface is simple and user-friendly. The standalone version allows offline analysis and integration into existing data processing pipelines. DeconSeq’s results reveal whether the sequencing experiment has succeeded, whether the correct sample was sequenced, and whether the sample contains any sequence contamination from DNA preparation or host. In addition, the analysis of 202 metagenomes demonstrated significant contamination of the non-human associated metagenomes, suggesting that this method is appropriate for screening all metagenomes. DeconSeq is available at http://deconseq.sourceforge.net/.","Public Library of Science","","Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2011-03-09T05:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e17288","","","AC02-06CH11357; DBI 0850356","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0017288","","2024-11-25T05:00:00Z","1627446","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627446","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627446","PLoS ONE","3","6"
"Seven Golden Rules for heuristic filtering of molecular formulas obtained by accurate mass spectrometry","Kind, Tobias; Fiehn, Oliver","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology","Background: Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas. Results: An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6% of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80– 99% probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5% absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries. Conclusion: The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98% if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65–81%.
