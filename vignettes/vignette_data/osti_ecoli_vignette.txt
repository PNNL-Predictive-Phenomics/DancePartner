<title>ABSTRACT</title>  <p>  Microbes can be found in abundance many kilometers underground. While microbial metabolic capabilities have been examined across different geochemical settings, it remains unclear how changes in subsurface niches affect microbial needs to sense and respond to their environment. To address this question, we examined how microbial extracellular sensor systems vary with environmental conditions across metagenomes at different Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) subsurface sites. Because two-component systems (TCSs) directly sense extracellular conditions and convert this information into intracellular biochemical responses, we expected that this sensor family would vary across isolated oligotrophic subterranean environments that differ in abiotic and biotic conditions. TCSs were found at all six subsurface sites, the service water control, and the surface site, with an average of 0.88 sensor histidine kinases (HKs) per 100 genes across all sites. Abundance was greater in subsurface fracture fluids compared with surface-derived fluids, and candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacteria presented the lowest HK frequencies. Measures of microbial diversity, such as the Shannon diversity index, revealed that HK abundance is inversely correlated with microbial diversity (  <italic>r</italic>  <sup>2</sup>  = 0.81). Among the geochemical parameters measured, HK frequency correlated most strongly with variance in dissolved organic carbon (  <italic>r</italic>  <sup>2</sup>  = 0.82). Taken together, these results implicate the abiotic and biotic properties of an ecological niche as drivers of sensor needs, and they suggest that microbes in environments with large fluctuations in organic nutrients (e.g., lacustrine, terrestrial, and coastal ecosystems) may require greater TCS diversity than ecosystems with low nutrients (e.g., open ocean).  </p>  <sec>  <title>IMPORTANCE</title>  <p>The ability to detect extracellular environmental conditions is a fundamental property of all life forms. Because microbial two-component sensor systems convert information about extracellular conditions into biochemical information that controls their behaviors, we evaluated how two-component sensor systems evolved within the deep Earth across multiple sites where abiotic and biotic properties vary. We show that these sensor systems remain abundant in microbial consortia at all subterranean sampling sites and observe correlations between sensor system abundances and abiotic (dissolved organic carbon variation) and biotic (consortia diversity) properties. These results suggest that multiple environmental properties may drive sensor protein evolution and highlight the need for further studies of metagenomic and geochemical data in parallel to understand the drivers of microbial sensor evolution.</p>  </sec>	Goldman, Annelise L.|Fulk, Emily M.|Momper, Lily M.|Heider, Clinton|Mulligan, John|Osburn, Magdalena|Masiello, Caroline A.|Silberg, Jonathan J.

<title>ABSTRACT</title>  <p>  The functional versatility of the Fe protein, the reductase component of nitrogenase, makes it an appealing target for heterologous expression, which could facilitate future biotechnological adaptations of nitrogenase-based production of valuable chemical commodities. Yet, the heterologous synthesis of a fully active Fe protein of  <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic>  (  <italic>Av</italic>  NifH) in  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  has proven to be a challenging task. Here, we report the successful synthesis of a fully active  <italic>Av</italic>  NifH protein upon co-expression of this protein with  <italic>Av</italic>  IscS/U and  <italic>Av</italic>  NifM in  <italic>E. coli</italic>  . Our metal, activity, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy/extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data demonstrate that the heterologously expressed  <italic>Av</italic>  NifH protein has a high [Fe  <sub>4</sub>  S  <sub>4</sub>  ] cluster content and is fully functional in nitrogenase catalysis and assembly. Moreover, our phylogenetic analyses and structural predictions suggest that  <italic>Av</italic>  NifM could serve as a chaperone and assist the maturation of a cluster-replete  <italic>Av</italic>  NifH protein. Given the crucial importance of the Fe protein for the functionality of nitrogenase, this work establishes an effective framework for developing a heterologous expression system of the complete, two-component nitrogenase system; additionally, it provides a useful tool for further exploring the intricate biosynthetic mechanism of this structurally unique and functionally important metalloenzyme.  </p>  <sec>  <title>IMPORTANCE</title>  <p>  The heterologous expression of a fully active  <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic>  Fe protein (AvNifH) has never been accomplished. Given the functional importance of this protein in nitrogenase catalysis and assembly, the successful expression of AvNifH in  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  as reported herein supplies a key element for the further development of heterologous expression systems that explore the catalytic versatility of the Fe protein, either on its own or as a key component of nitrogenase, for nitrogenase-based biotechnological applications in the future. Moreover, the “clean” genetic background of the heterologous expression host allows for an unambiguous assessment of the effect of certain nif-encoded protein factors, such as AvNifM described in this work, in the maturation of AvNifH, highlighting the utility of this heterologous expression system in further advancing our understanding of the complex biosynthetic mechanism of nitrogenase.  </p>  </sec>	Solomon, Joseph B.|Liu, Yiling A.|Górecki, Kamil|Quechol, Robert|Lee, Chi Chung|Jasniewski, Andrew J.|Hu, Yilin|Ribbe, Markus W.	/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Solomon, Joseph B.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Liu, Yiling A.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Górecki, Kamil|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Quechol, Robert|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Lee, Chi Chung|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Jasniewski, Andrew J.|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Hu, Yilin|USA/Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry/Ribbe, Markus W.

Iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) are required elements for life, and changes in their availability can limit the ecological distribution and function of microorganisms. In anoxic environments, soluble Fe typically exists as ferrous iron [Fe(II)] and S as sulfide (HS<sup>–</sup>). These species exhibit a strong affinity that ultimately drives the formation of sedimentary pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>). Recently, paradigm-shifting studies indicate that Fe and S in FeS<sub>2</sub> can be made bioavailable by methanogens through a reductive dissolution process. However, the impact of the utilization of FeS<sub>2</sub>, as opposed to canonical Fe and S sources, on the phenotype of cells is not fully understood. Here, shotgun proteomics was utilized to measure changes in the phenotype of Methanosarcina barkeri MS grown with FeS<sub>2</sub>, Fe(II)/HS<sup>–</sup>, or Fe(II)/cysteine. Shotgun proteomics tracked 1,019 proteins overall, with 307 observed to change between growth conditions. Functional characterization and pathway analyses revealed these changes to be systemic and largely tangential to Fe/S metabolism. As a final step, the proteomics data were viewed with respect to previously collected transcriptomics data to deepen the analysis. Presented here is evidence that M. barkeri adopts distinct phenotypes to exploit specific sources of Fe and S in its environment. This is supported by observed protein abundance changes across broad categories of cellular biology. DNA adjacent metabolism, central carbon metabolism methanogenesis, metal trafficking, quorum sensing, and porphyrin biosynthesis pathways are all features in the phenotypic differentiation. Differences in trace metal availability attributed to complexation with HS<sup>–</sup>, either as a component of the growth medium [Fe(II)/HS<sup>–</sup>] or generated through reduction of FeS<sub>2</sub>, were likely a major factor underpinning these phenotypic differences.

Microbial growth emerges from coordinated synthesis of various cellular components from limited resources. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated signaling is shown to orchestrate cellular metabolism; however, it remains unclear quantitatively how the controlling circuit drives resource partition and subsequently shapes biomass growth. Here we combined experiment with mathematical modeling to dissect the signaling-mediated growth optimization of S. cerevisiae. We showed that, through cAMP-mediated control, the organism achieves maximal or nearly maximal steady-state growth during the utilization of multiple tested substrates as well as under perturbations impairing glucose uptake. However, the optimal cAMP concentration varies across cases, suggesting that different modes of resource allocation are adopted for varied conditions. Under settings with nutrient alterations, S. cerevisiae tunes its cAMP level to dynamically reprogram itself to realize rapid adaptation. Moreover, to achieve growth maximization, cells employ additional regulatory systems such as the GCN2-mediated amino acid control. This study establishes a systematic understanding of global resource allocation in S. cerevisiae, providing insights into quantitative yeast physiology as well as metabolic strain engineering for biotechnological applications.

Many microorganisms are auxotrophic—unable to synthesize the compounds they require for growth. With this work, we quantify the prevalence of amino acid auxotrophies across a broad diversity of bacteria and habitats. We predicted the amino acid biosynthetic capabilities of 26,277 unique bacterial genomes spanning 12 phyla using a metabolic pathway model validated with empirical data. Amino acid auxotrophy is widespread across bacterial phyla, but we conservatively estimate that the majority of taxa (78.4%) are able to synthesize all amino acids. Our estimates indicate that amino acid auxotrophies are more prevalent among obligate intracellular parasites and in free-living taxa with genomic attributes characteristic of ‘streamlined’ life history strategies. We predicted the amino acid biosynthetic capabilities of bacterial communities found in 12 unique habitats to investigate environmental associations with auxotrophy, using data compiled from 3813 samples spanning major aquatic, terrestrial, and engineered environments. Auxotrophic taxa were more abundant in host-associated environments (including the human oral cavity and gut) and in fermented food products, with auxotrophic taxa being relatively rare in soil and aquatic systems. Overall, this work contributes to a more complete understanding of amino acid auxotrophy across the bacterial tree of life and the ecological contexts in which auxotrophy can be a successful strategy.

Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) contribute to one of the largest nitrogen fluxes in the global nitrogen budget. Four distinct lineages of AOM: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), beta- and gamma-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (β-AOB and γ-AOB) and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox), are thought to compete for ammonia as their primary nitrogen substrate. In addition, many AOM species can utilize urea as an alternative energy and nitrogen source through hydrolysis to ammonia. How the coordination of ammonia and urea metabolism in AOM influences their ecology remains poorly understood. Here we use stable isotope tracing, kinetics and transcriptomics experiments to show that representatives of the AOM lineages employ distinct regulatory strategies for ammonia or urea utilization, thereby minimizing direct substrate competition. The tested AOA and comammox species preferentially used ammonia over urea, while β-AOB favoured urea utilization, repressed ammonia transport in the presence of urea and showed higher affinity for urea than for ammonia. Characterized γ-AOB co-utilized both substrates. Furthermore, these results reveal contrasting niche adaptation and coexistence patterns among the major AOM lineages.

The Salicaceae family is of growing interest in the study of dioecy in plants because the sex determination region (SDR) has been shown to be highly dynamic, with dif fering locations and heterogametic systems between species. Without the ability to transform and regenerate Salix in tissue culture, previous studies investigating the mechanisms regulating sex in the genus Salix have been limited to genome resequen cing and differential gene expression, which are mostly descriptive in nature, and functional validation of candidate sex determination genes has not yet been con ducted. Here, we used Arabidopsis to functionally characterize a suite of previously identified candidate genes involved in sex determination and sex dimorphism in the bioenergy shrub willow Salix purpurea. Six candidate master regulator genes for sex determination were heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis, followed by floral pro teome analysis. In addition, 11 transcription factors with predicted roles in mediating sex dimorphism downstream of the SDR were tested using DAP-Seq in both male and female S. purpurea DNA. The results of this study provide further evidence to support models for the roles of ARR17 and GATA15 as master regulator genes of sex determination in S. purpurea, contributing to a regulatory system that is notably dif ferent from that of its sister genus Populus. Evidence was also obtained for the roles of two transcription factors, an AP2/ERF family gene and a homeodomain-like transcription factor, in downstream regulation of sex dimorphism.

<title>ABSTRACT</title>  <p>  The microbiome is an underappreciated contributor to intestinal drug metabolism with broad implications for drug efficacy and toxicity. While considerable progress has been made toward identifying the gut bacterial genes and enzymes involved, the role of environmental factors in shaping their activity remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the gut bacterial reduction of azo bonds (R-N = N-R’), found in diverse chemicals in both food and drugs. Surprisingly, the canonical  <italic>azoR</italic>  gene in  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  was dispensable for azo bond reduction. Instead, azoreductase activity was controlled by the fumarate and nitrate reduction (  <italic>fnr</italic>  ) regulator, consistent with a requirement for the anoxic conditions found within the gastrointestinal tract. Paired transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the  <italic>fnr</italic>  regulon revealed that in addition to altering the expression of multiple reductases, FNR is necessary for the metabolism of L-Cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, enabling the degradation of azo bonds. Furthermore, we found that FNR indirectly regulates this process through the small noncoding regulatory RNA  <italic>fnrS</italic>  . Taken together, these results show how gut bacteria sense and respond to their intestinal environment to enable the metabolism of chemical groups found in both dietary and pharmaceutical compounds.  </p>  <sec>  <title>IMPORTANCE</title>  <p>  This work has broad relevance due to the ubiquity of dyes containing azo bonds in food and drugs. We report that azo dyes can be degraded by human gut bacteria through both enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms, even from a single gut bacterial species. Furthermore, we revealed that environmental factors, oxygen, and L-Cysteine control the ability of  <italic>E. coli</italic>  to degrade azo dyes due to their impacts on bacterial transcription and metabolism. These results open up new opportunities to manipulate the azoreductase activity of the gut microbiome through the manipulation of host diet, suggest that azoreductase potential may be altered in patients suffering from gastrointestinal disease, and highlight the importance of studying bacterial enzymes for drug metabolism in their natural cellular and ecological context.  </p>  </sec>	Pieper, Lindsey M.|Spanogiannopoulos, Peter|Volk, Regan F.|Miller, Carson J.|Wright, Aaron T.|Turnbaugh, Peter J.

Type I polyketide synthases (T1PKSs) hold enormous potential as a rational production platform for the biosynthesis of specialty chemicals. However, despite great progress in this field, the heterologous expression of PKSs remains a major challenge. One of the first measures to improve heterologous gene expression can be codon optimization. Although controversial, choosing the wrong codon optimization strategy can have detrimental effects on the protein and product levels. In this study, we analyzed 11 different codon variants of an engineered T1PKS and investigated in a systematic approach their influence on heterologous expression in Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas putida. Our best performing codon variants exhibited a minimum 50-fold increase in PKS protein levels, which also enabled the production of an unnatural polyketide in each of these hosts. Furthermore, we developed a free online tool (https://basebuddy.lbl.gov) that offers transparent and highly customizable codon optimization with up-to-date codon usage tables. In this work, we not only highlight the significance of codon optimization but also establish the groundwork for the high-throughput assembly and characterization of PKS pathways in alternative hosts.						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00367		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c4a		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2202869		2202869	ACS Synthetic Biology	Journal Article			Maximizing Heterologous Expression of Engineered Type I Polyketide Synthases: Investigating Codon Optimization Strategies									
<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  In selected  <italic>Campylobacter</italic>  species, the biosynthesis of N‐linked glycoconjugates via the pgl pathway is essential for pathogenicity and survival. However, most of the membrane‐associated GT‐B fold glycosyltransferases responsible for diversifying glycans in this pathway have not been structurally characterized which hinders the understanding of the structural factors that govern substrate specificity and prediction of resulting glycan composition. Herein, we report the 1.8 Å resolution structure of  <italic>Campylobacter concisus</italic>  PglA, the glycosyltransferase responsible for the transfer of  <italic>N</italic>  ‐acetylgalatosamine (GalNAc) from uridine 5′‐diphospho‐  <italic>N</italic>  ‐acetylgalactosamine (UDP‐GalNAc) to undecaprenyl‐diphospho‐  <italic>N</italic>  ,  <italic>N</italic>  ′‐diacetylbacillosamine (UndPP‐diNAcBac) in complex with the sugar donor GalNAc. This study identifies distinguishing characteristics that set PglA apart within the GT4 enzyme family. Computational docking of the structure in the membrane in comparison to homologs points to differences in interactions with the membrane‐embedded acceptor and the structural analysis of the complex together with bioinformatics and site‐directed mutagenesis identifies donor sugar binding motifs. Notably, E113, conserved solely among PglA enzymes, forms a hydrogen bond with the GalNAc C6″‐OH. Mutagenesis of E113 reveals activity consistent with this role in substrate binding, rather than stabilization of the oxocarbenium ion transition state, a function sometimes ascribed to the corresponding residue in GT4 homologs. The bioinformatic analyses reveal a substrate‐specificity motif, showing that Pro281 in a substrate binding loop of PglA directs configurational preference for GalNAc over GlcNAc. This proline is replaced by a conformationally flexible glycine, even in distant homologs, which favor substrates with the same stereochemistry at C4, such as glucose. The signature loop is conserved across all  <italic>Campylobacter</italic>  PglA enzymes, emphasizing its importance in substrate specificity.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4848		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c44		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2263263		2263263	Protein Science	Journal Article			Specificity determinants revealed by the structure of glycosyltransferase  <i>Campylobacter concisus</i>  <scp>PglA</scp>									
Medium-chain fatty alcohols (<sup>mc</sup>FaOHs) are aliphatic primary alcohols containing six to twelve carbons that are widely used in materials, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Microbial biosynthesis has been touted as a route to less-abundant chain-length molecules and as a sustainable alternative to current petrochemical processes. Several metabolic engineering strategies for producing <sup>mc</sup>FaOHs have been demonstrated in the literature, yet processes continue to suffer from poor selectivity and <sup>mc</sup>FaOH toxicity, leading to reduced titers, rates, and yields of the desired compounds. Here, this opinion examines the current state of microbial <sup>mc</sup>FaOH biosynthesis, summarizing engineering efforts to tailor selectivity and improve product tolerance by implementing engineering strategies that circumvent or overcome <sup>mc</sup>FaOH toxicity.

<p>  Molecular tools for optogenetic control allow for spatial and temporal regulation of cell behavior. In particular, light-controlled protein degradation is a valuable mechanism of regulation because it can be highly modular, used in tandem with other control mechanisms, and maintain functionality throughout growth phases. Here, we engineered LOVdeg, a tag that can be appended to a protein of interest for inducible degradation in  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  using blue light. We demonstrate the modularity of LOVdeg by using it to tag a range of proteins, including the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activator, and the AcrB efflux pump. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of pairing the LOVdeg tag with existing optogenetic tools to enhance performance by developing a combined EL222 and LOVdeg system. Finally, we use the LOVdeg tag in a metabolic engineering application to demonstrate post-translational control of metabolism. Together, our results highlight the modularity and functionality of the LOVdeg tag system and introduce a powerful new tool for bacterial optogenetics.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.87303		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c33		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2282793		2282793	eLife	Journal Article			Light-inducible protein degradation in E. coli with the LOVdeg tag									
Monoterpenes are commonly known for their role in the flavors and fragrances industry and are also gaining attention for other uses like insect repellant and as potential renewable fuels for aviation. Corynebacterium glutamicum, a Generally Recognized as Safe microbe, has been a choice organism in industry for the annual million ton-scale bioproduction of amino acids for more than 50 years; however, efforts to produce monoterpenes in C. glutamicum have remained relatively limited. In this study, we report a further expansion of the C. glutamicum biosynthetic repertoire through the development and optimization of a mevalonate-based monoterpene platform. In the course of our plasmid design iterations, we increased flux through the mevalonate-based bypass pathway, measuring isoprenol production as a proxy for monoterpene precursor abundance and demonstrating the highest reported titers in C. glutamicum to date at 1504.6 mg/L. Our designs also evaluated the effects of backbone, promoter, and GPP synthase homolog origin on monoterpene product titers. Monoterpene production was further improved by disrupting competing pathways for isoprenoid precursor supply and by implementing a biphasic production system to prevent volatilization. With this platform, we achieved 321.1 mg/L of geranoids, 723.6 mg/L of 1,8-cineole, and 227.8 mg/L of linalool. Furthermore, we determined that C. glutamicum first oxidizes geraniol through an aldehyde intermediate before it is asymmetrically reduced to citronellol. Additionally, we demonstrate that the aldehyde reductase, AdhC, possesses additional substrate promiscuity for acyclic monoterpene aldehydes.

Design patterns are generalized solutions to frequently recurring problems. They were initially developed by architects and computer scientists to create a higher level of abstraction for their designs. Here, we extend these concepts to cell biology to lend a new perspective on the evolved designs of cells' underlying reaction networks. We present a catalog of 21 design patterns divided into three categories: creational patterns describe processes that build the cell, structural patterns describe the layouts of reaction networks, and behavioral patterns describe reaction network function. Applying this pattern language to the <em>E. coli</em> central metabolic reaction network, the yeast pheromone response signaling network, and other examples lends new insights into these systems.

Pea (legume plant defense) phytoalexin pterocarpans (–)-maackiain and (+)-pisatin have opposite C6a and C11a configurations, but how this occurs biosynthetically is unknown. Herein, pea dirigent-protein (DP) PsPTS2, which generates 7,2'-dihydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflav-3-ene (DMDIF), was investigated as regards stereoselectivity towards four possible 7,2'-dihydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflavan-4-ol (DMDI) stereoisomers. Each DMDI stereoisomer configuration was determined using NMR spectroscopy, electronic circular dichroism, and molecular orbital analyses. PsPTS2 efficiently converted cis-(3R,4R)-DMDI into DMDIF, this being 20-fold faster than with the trans-(3R,4S)-isomer. The 4R-configured substrate’s near ß-axial OH orientation significantly enhanced its leaving group abilities in creating intermediate A-ring mono-quinone methide (QM), whereas the 4S-isomer’s 4-OH group α-equatorial orientation was a poorer leaving group. Substrate docking simulations also indicated that the 4R-configured ß-axial OH was closest to the Asp catalytic center, whereas the 4S-isomer’s α-equatorial OH was further away. Neither cis-(3S,4S)- nor trans-(3S, 4R)-DMDIs were substrates, even with the former having the same C3/C4 stereochemistry as (+)-pisatin. PsPTS2, assayed with cis-(3R,4R)-7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavan-4-ol [cis-(3R,4R)-DMI] and its C3/C4 stereoisomers, gave 2',7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflav-3-ene (DMIF), with the same substrate stereoselectivity. DP homologs may exist in licorice (Glycyrrhiza pallidiflora) and the tree legume Bolusanthus speciosus, as DMIF is found in both. PsPTS1 preferentially utilized cis-(3R,4R)-DMDI to give (–)-maackiain, this being 2200-fold more efficient than with cis-(3R,4R)-DMI. PsPTS1 also slowly converted trans-(3S,4R)-DMDI into (+)-maackiain, again reflecting the better 4R configured OH leaving group. Pea PsPTS2 and PsPTS1 provisionally provide a facile DP-engendered means to enable differing C6a and C11a configurations in (+)-pisatin and (–)-maackiain. Both DP transformations are considered to occur via DP-engendered generation of an identical mono-QM bound intermediate, which with PsPTS2 either re-aromatizes to give DMDIF or with PsPTS1 undergoes intramolecular cyclization to afford (–)-maackiain. Substrate docking simulations using PsPTS2 (2.5 Å resolution) and PsPTS1 (1.5 Å resolution) plausibly indicate that cis-(3R,4R)-DMDI binds in the anti-configuration in the PsPTS2 active site to afford DMDIF, and the syn-configuration in PsPTS1 to give maackiain.

<p>The development of cancer is not just the growth and proliferation of a single transformed cell, but its tumor microenvironment (TME) also coevolves with it, which is primarily involved in tumor initiation, development, metastasis, and therapeutic responses. Recent years, TME has been emerged as a potential target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the clinical efficacy of treatments targeting the TME, especially its specific components, remains insufficient. In parallel, the gut microbiome is an essential TME component that is crucial in cancer immunotherapy. Thus, assessing and constructing frameworks between the gut microbiota and the TME can significantly enhance the exploration of effective treatment strategies for various tumors. In this review the role of the gut microbiota in human cancers, including its function and relationship with various tumors was summarized. In addition, the interaction between the gut microbiota and the TME as well as its potential applications in cancer therapeutics was described. Furthermore, it was summarized that fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary adjustments, and synthetic biology to introduce gut microbiota-based medical technologies for cancer treatment. This review provides a comprehensive summary for uncovering the mechanism underlying the effects of the gut microbiota on the TME and lays a foundation for the development of personalized medicine in further studies.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1287077		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c4d		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2282395		2282395	Frontiers in Microbiology	Journal Article			Gut microbiota and its therapeutic implications in tumor microenvironment interactions									
<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Due to the scarcity of organic matter (OM) sources in the bathypelagic (1000–4000 m depth), prokaryotic metabolism is believed to be concentrated on particles originating from the surface. However, the structure of active bathypelagic prokaryotic communities and how it changes across environmental gradients remains unexplored. Using a combination of 16S rRNA gene and transcripts sequencing, metagenomics, and substrate uptake potential measurements, here we aimed to explore how water masses aging and the quality of OM influence the structure of the active microbiome, and the potential implications for community function. We found that the relative contribution of taxa with a free‐living lifestyle to the active microbiome increased in older water masses that were enriched in recalcitrant OM, suggesting that these prokaryotes may also play a substantial role in the bathypelagic metabolism of vast areas of the ocean. In comparison to particle‐associated prokaryotes, free‐living prokaryotes exhibited lower potential metabolic rates, and harbored a limited number of two‐component sensory systems, suggesting they have less ability to sense and respond to environmental cues. In contrast, particle‐associated prokaryotes carried genes for particle colonization and carbohydrate utilization that were absent in prokaryotes with a free‐living lifestyle. Consistently, we observed that prokaryotic communities inhabiting older waters displayed reduced abilities to colonize particles, and higher capabilities to use complex carbon sources, compared to communities in waters with a higher proportion of labile OM. Our results provide evidence of regionalization of the bathypelagic active prokaryotic microbiome, unveiling a niche partitioning based on the quality of OM.</p>	Sebastián, Marta|Sánchez, Pablo|Salazar, Guillem	Institut de Ciències del Mar CSIC  Barcelona Catalunya Spain/Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography/Sebastián, Marta|Institut de Ciències del Mar CSIC  Barcelona Catalunya Spain/Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography/Sánchez, Pablo|Institut de Ciències del Mar CSIC  Barcelona Catalunya Spain/Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography/Sebastián, Marta|Institut de Ciències del Mar CSIC  Barcelona Catalunya Spain/Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography/Sánchez, Pablo|ETH Zurich  Zürich Switzerland/Department of Biology Institute of Microbiology and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics/Salazar, Guillem			Institut de Ciències del Mar CSIC  Barcelona Catalunya Spain|ETH Zurich  Zürich Switzerland	e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12505		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c48		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2331323	Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography|Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography|Department of Biology Institute of Microbiology and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics	2331323	Limnology and Oceanography	Journal Article			Water aging and the quality of organic carbon sources drive niche partitioning of the active bathypelagic prokaryotic microbiome									
Whole-cell modeling is “the ultimate goal” of computational systems biology and “a grand challenge for 21st century”. These complex, highly detailed models account for the activity of every molecule in a cell and serve as comprehensive knowledgebases for the modeled system. Their scope and utility far surpass those of other systems models. In fact, whole-cell models (WCMs) are an amalgam of several types of “system” models. The models are simulated using a hybrid modeling method where the appropriate mathematical methods for each biological process are used to simulate their behavior. Given the complexity of the models, the process of developing and curating these models is labor-intensive and to date only a handful of these models have been developed. While whole-cell models provide valuable and novel biological insights, and to date have identified some novel biological phenomena, their most important contribution has been to highlight the discrepancy between available data and observations that are used for the parametrization and validation of complex biological models. Another realization has been that current whole-cell modeling simulators are slow and to run models that mimic more complex (e.g., multi-cellular) biosystems, those need to be executed in an accelerated fashion on high-performance computing platforms. In this manuscript, we review the progress of whole-cell modeling to date and discuss some of the ways that they can be improved.

Regulation of metabolic gene expression is crucial for maximizing bioproduction titers. Recent engineering tools including CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) have enabled effective knock-out, knock-down, and overexpression of endogenous pathway genes, respectively, for advanced strain engineering. CRISPRi in particular has emerged as a powerful tool for gene repression through the use of a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein and target guide RNA (gRNA). By constructing gRNA arrays, CRISPRi has the capacity for multiplexed gene downregulation across multiple orthogonal pathways for enhanced bioproduction titers. In this study, we harnessed CRISPRi to downregulate 32 essential and non-essential genes in E. coli strains heterologously expressing either the original mevalonate pathway or isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) bypass pathway for isoprenol biosynthesis. Isoprenol remains a candidate bioproduct both as a drop-in blend additive and as a precursor for the high-performance sustainable aviation fuel, 1,4-dimethylcyclooctane (DMCO). Of the 32 gRNAs targeting genes associated with isoprenol biosynthesis, a subset was found to vastly improve product titers. Construction of a multiplexed gRNA library based on single guide RNA (sgRNA) performance enabled simultaneous gene repression, yielding a 3 to 4.5-fold increase in isoprenol titer (1.82 ± 0.19 g/L) on M9-MOPS minimal medium. We then scaled the best performing CRISPRi strain to 2-L fed-batch cultivation and demonstrated translatable titer improvements, ultimately obtaining 12.4 ± 1.3 g/L isoprenol. Our strategy further establishes CRISPRi as a powerful tool for tuning metabolic flux in production hosts and that titer improvements are readily scalable with potential for applications in industrial bioproduction.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  13C‐Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C‐MFA) and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) are widely used to investigate the operation of biochemical networks in both biological and biotechnological research. Both methods use metabolic reaction network models of metabolism operating at steady state so that reaction rates (fluxes) and the levels of metabolic intermediates are constrained to be invariant. They provide estimated (MFA) or predicted (FBA) values of the fluxes through the network in vivo, which cannot be measured directly. These fluxes can shed light on basic biology and have been successfully used to inform metabolic engineering strategies. Several approaches have been taken to test the reliability of estimates and predictions from constraint‐based methods and to compare alternative model architectures. Despite advances in other areas of the statistical evaluation of metabolic models, such as the quantification of flux estimate uncertainty, validation and model selection methods have been underappreciated and underexplored. We review the history and state‐of‐the‐art in constraint‐based metabolic model validation and model selection. Applications and limitations of the χ  <sup>2</sup>  ‐test of goodness‐of‐fit, the most widely used quantitative validation and selection approach in 13C‐MFA, are discussed, and complementary and alternative forms of validation and selection are proposed. A combined model validation and selection framework for 13C‐MFA incorporating metabolite pool size information that leverages new developments in the field is presented and advocated for. Finally, we discuss how adopting robust validation and selection procedures can enhance confidence in constraint‐based modeling as a whole and ultimately facilitate more widespread use of FBA in biotechnology.  </p>	Kaste, Joshua A.

Stable isotope tracers are a powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of microbial metabolism, enabling pathway elucidation, metabolic flux quantification, and assessment of reaction and pathway thermodynamics. <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>2</sup>H metabolic flux analysis commonly relies on isotopically labeled carbon substrates, such as glucose. However, the use of <sup>2</sup>H-labeled nutrient substrates faces limitations due to their high cost and limited availability in comparison to <sup>13</sup>C-tracers. Furthermore, isotope tracer studies in industrially relevant bacteria that metabolize complex substrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignocellulosic biomass, are challenging given the difficulty in obtaining these as isotopically labeled substrates. In this study, we examine the potential of deuterated water (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) as an affordable, substrate-neutral isotope tracer for studying central carbon metabolism. We apply <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O labeling to investigate the reversibility of glycolytic reactions across three industrially relevant bacterial species -C. thermocellum, Z. mobilis, and E. coli-harboring distinct glycolytic pathways with unique thermodynamics. We demonstrate that <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O labeling recapitulates previous reversibility and thermodynamic findings obtained with established <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>2</sup>H labeled nutrient substrates. Furthermore, we exemplify the utility of this <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O labeling approach by applying it to high-substrate C. thermocellum fermentations -a setting in which the use of conventional tracers is impractical-thereby identifying the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase as a major bottleneck during high-substrate fermentations and unveiling critical insights that will steer future engineering efforts to enhance ethanol production in this cellulolytic organism. This study demonstrates the utility of deuterated water as a substrate-agnostic isotope tracer for examining flux and reversibility of central carbon metabolic reactions, which yields biological insights comparable to those obtained using costly <sup>2</sup>H-labeled nutrient substrates.

Microorganisms that persist in fractured shale reservoirs cause several problems including secreting foul gases and forming biofilms. Current biocontrol measures often fail due to limited knowledge of their in situ activities. The plasma membrane protects the cell, mediates many of its critical functions, and responds to intracellular cues and ecological perturbations through physicochemical modifications. As such, it provides valuable insight into the physiological adaptation of microorganisms in disturbed environmental systems. Here, we (i) demonstrate how changes in salinity and hydraulic retention time (HRT) influence the plasma membrane intact polar lipid (IPL) chemistry of model bacterium, Halanaerobium congolense WG10, and mixed microbial consortia enriched from shale-produced fluids and (ii) elucidate adjustments in membrane IPL chemistry during biofilm growth relative to planktonic cells. We incubated H. congolense WG10 in chemostats under three salinities (7%, 13%, and 20% NaCl), operated under three HRTs (19.2, 24, and 48 h), and in drip flow biofilm reactors under the same salinity gradients. Also, mixed microbial consortia in produced fluids were enriched in triplicate chemostat vessels under three HRTs (19.2, 24, and 72 h) and biofilm reactors. Lipids were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Our results show that phosphatidylglycerols, cardiolipins, and phosphatidylethanolamines were predominantly enriched in planktonic H. congolense WG10 cells grown at hypersalinity (20%) compared to optimum (13%). In addition, several zwitterionic phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were higher in abundance during biofilm growth. These observations suggest that microbial adaptation and biofilm formation in fractured shale are enabled by strategic plasma membrane IPL chemistry adjustments	Ugwuodo, Chika Jude|Colosimo, Fabrizio|Adhikari, Jishnu|Bloodsworth, Kent|Wright, Stephanie A.|Eder, Josie|Mouser, Paula J.

<title>Abstract</title>  <sec>  <title>Background</title>  <p>  Recent engineering efforts have targeted the ethanologenic bacterium  <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>  for isobutanol production. However, significant hurdles remain due this organism’s vulnerability to isobutanol toxicity, adversely affecting its growth and productivity. The limited understanding of the physiological impacts of isobutanol on  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  constrains our ability to overcome these production barriers.  </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>Results</title>  <p>  We utilized a systems-level approach comprising LC–MS/MS-based lipidomics, metabolomics, and shotgun proteomics, to investigate how exposure to ethanol and isobutanol impact the lipid membrane composition and overall physiology of  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  . Our analysis revealed significant and distinct alterations in membrane phospholipid and fatty acid composition resulting from ethanol and isobutanol exposure. Notably, ethanol exposure increased membrane cyclopropane fatty acid content and expression of cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthase. Surprisingly, isobutanol decreased cyclopropane fatty acid content despite robust upregulation of CFA synthase. Overexpression of the native  <italic>Z. mobilis’</italic>  CFA synthase increased cyclopropane fatty acid content in all phospholipid classes and was associated with a significant improvement in growth rates in the presence of added ethanol and isobutanol. Heterologous expression of CFA synthase from  <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic>  resulted in a near complete replacement of unsaturated fatty acids with cyclopropane fatty acids, affecting all lipid classes. However, this did not translate to improved growth rates under isobutanol exposure.  </p>  <p>  Correlating with its greater susceptibility to isobutanol,  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  exhibited more pronounced alterations in its proteome, metabolome, and overall cell morphology—including cell swelling and formation of intracellular protein aggregates —when exposed to isobutanol compared to ethanol. Isobutanol triggered a broad stress response marked by the upregulation of heat shock proteins, efflux transporters, DNA repair systems, and the downregulation of cell motility proteins. Isobutanol also elicited widespread dysregulation of  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  ’ primary metabolism evidenced by increased levels of nucleotide degradation intermediates and the depletion of biosynthetic and glycolytic intermediates.  </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>Conclusions</title>  <p>  This study provides a comprehensive, systems-level evaluation of the impact of ethanol and isobutanol exposure on the lipid membrane composition and overall physiology of  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  .

The homodimeric Type I reaction center (RC) from Heliomicrobium modesticaldum lacks the PsaC subunit found in Photosystem I and instead uses the interpolypeptide [4Fe–4S] cluster F<sub>X</sub> as the terminal electron acceptor. Our goal was to identify which of the small mobile dicluster ferredoxins encoded by the H. modesticaldum genome are capable of accepting electrons from the heliobacterial RC (HbRC) and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), a key metabolic enzyme. Analysis of the genome revealed seven candidates: HM1_1462 (PshB1), HM1_1461 (PshB2), HM1_2505 (Fdx3), HM1_0869 (FdxB), HM1_1043, HM1_0357, and HM1_2767. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and studies using time-resolved optical spectroscopy revealed that only PshB1, PshB2, and Fdx3 are capable of accepting electrons from the HbRC and PFOR. Modeling studies using AlphaFold show that only PshB1, PshB2, and Fdx3 should be capable of docking on PFOR at a positively charged patch that overlays a surface-proximal [4Fe–4S] cluster. Proteomic analysis of wild-type and gene deletion strains ΔpshB1, ΔpshB2, ΔpshB1pshB2, and Δfdx3 grown under nitrogen-replete conditions revealed that Fdx3 is undetectable in the wild-type, ΔpshB1, and Δfdx3 strains, but it is present in the ΔpshB2 and ΔpshB1pshB2 strains, implying that Fdx3 may substitute for PshB2. When grown under nitrogen-deplete conditions, Fdx3 is present in the wild-type and all deletion strains except for Δfdx3. None of the knockout strains demonstrated significant impairment during chemotrophic dark growth on pyruvate, photoheterotrophic light growth on pyruvate, or phototrophic growth on acetate+CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating a high degree of redundancy among these three electron transfer proteins. As a result, loss of both PshB1 and PshB2, but not FdxB, resulted in poor growth under N<sub>2</sub>-fixing conditions.	Walters, Karim A.|Redding, Kevin E.|Golbeck, John H.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  Small multidrug resistance transporters efflux toxic compounds from bacteria and are a minimal system to understand multidrug transport. Most previous studies have focused on EmrE, the model SMR from  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  , finding that EmrE has a broader substrate profile than previously thought and that EmrE may perform multiple types of transport, resulting in substrate‐dependent resistance  <italic>or susceptibility</italic>  . Here, we performed a broad screen to identify potential substrates of three other SMRs: PAsmr from  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>  ; FTsmr from  <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>  ; and SAsmr from  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>  . This screen tested metabolic differences  <italic>in E. coli</italic>  expressing each transporter versus an inactive mutant, for a clean comparison of sequence and substrate‐specific differences in transporter function, and identified many substrates for each transporter. In general, resistance compounds were charged, and susceptibility substrates were uncharged, but hydrophobicity was not correlated with phenotype. Two resistance hits and two susceptibility hits were validated via growth assays and IC50 calculations. Susceptibility is proposed to occur via substrate‐gated proton leak, and the addition of bicarbonate antagonizes the susceptibility phenotype, consistent with this hypothesis.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15231		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5c2e		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2283114		2283114	Molecular Microbiology	Journal Article			Functional promiscuity of small multidrug resistance transporters from  <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>  ,  <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>  , and  <i>Francisella tularensis</i>									
Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.

Isoprenoids are a very large and diverse family of metabolites required by all living organisms. All isoprenoids derive from the double-bond isomers isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are produced by the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in bacteria and plant plastids. It has been reported that IPP and DMAPP feedback-regulate the activity of deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the main flux-controlling step of the MEP pathway. Here we provide experimental insights into the underlying mechanism. Isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering approaches showed that IPP and DMAPP can allosterically bind to DXS in vitro, causing a size shift. In silico ligand binding site analysis and docking calculations identified a potential allosteric site in the contact region between the two monomers of the active DXS dimer. Modulation of IPP and DMAPP contents in vivo followed by immunoblot analyses confirmed that high IPP/DMAPP levels resulted in monomerization and eventual aggregation of the enzyme in bacterial and plant cells. Loss of the enzymatically active dimeric conformation allows a fast and reversible reduction of DXS activity in response to a sudden increase or decrease in IPP/DMAPP supply, whereas aggregation and subsequent removal of monomers that would otherwise be available for dimerization appears to be a more drastic response in the case of persistent IPP/DMAPP overabundance (e.g., by a blockage in their conversion to downstream isoprenoids). Our results represent an important step toward understanding the regulation of the MEP pathway and rational design of biotechnological endeavors aimed at increasing isoprenoid contents in microbial and plant systems.

Lignocellulose forms plant cell walls, and its three constituent polymers, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, represent the largest renewable organic carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Insights into biological lignocellulose deconstruction inform understandings of global carbon sequestration dynamics and provide inspiration for biotechnologies seeking to address the current climate crisis by producing renewable chemicals from plant biomass. Organisms in diverse environments disassemble lignocellulose, and carbohydrate degradation processes are well defined, but biological lignin deconstruction is described only in aerobic systems. It is currently unclear whether anaerobic lignin deconstruction is impossible because of biochemical constraints or, alternatively, has not yet been measured. We applied whole cell-wall nuclear magnetic resonance, gel-permeation chromatography and transcriptome sequencing to interrogate the apparent paradox that anaerobic fungi (Neocallimastigomycetes), well-documented lignocellulose degradation specialists, are unable to modify lignin. We find that Neocallimastigomycetes anaerobically break chemical bonds in grass and hardwood lignins, and we further associate upregulated gene products with the observed lignocellulose deconstruction. These findings alter perceptions of lignin deconstruction by anaerobes and provide opportunities to advance decarbonization biotechnologies that depend on depolymerizing lignocellulose.

In the <em>Neurospora</em> circadian system, the White Collar Complex (WCC) drives expression of the principal circadian negative arm component <em>frequency</em> (<em>frq</em>). FRQ interacts with FRH (FRQ-interacting RNA helicase) and CKI, forming a stable complex that represses its own expression by inhibiting WCC. In this study, a genetic screen identified a gene, designated as <em>brd-8</em>, that encodes a conserved auxiliary subunit of the NuA4 histone acetylation complex. Loss of <em>brd-8</em> reduces H4 acetylation and RNA polymerase (Pol) II occupancy at <em>frq</em> and other known circadian genes, and leads to a long circadian period, delayed phase, and defective overt circadian output at some temperatures. In addition to strongly associating with the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, BRD-8 is also found complexed with the transcription elongation regulator BYE-1. Expression of <em>brd-8, bye-1, histone h2a.z</em>, and several NuA4 subunits is controlled by the circadian clock, indicating that the molecular clock both regulates the basic chromatin status and is regulated by changes in chromatin. Taken together, our data identify auxiliary elements of the fungal NuA4 complex having homology to mammalian components, which along with conventional NuA4 subunits, are required for timely and dynamic <em>frq</em> expression and thereby a normal and persistent circadian rhythm.

Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted pathogen. The number of chlamydial infections continuous to increase and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. To assess the ability of the Chlamydia muridarum polymorphic membrane protein G (PmpG) and the plasmid glycoprotein 3 (Pgp3) as single antigens, and in combination with the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP) to induce protection, BALB/c mice were immunized utilizing CpG-1826 and Montanide ISA 720 VG as adjuvants. Following vaccination with MOMP, significant humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were observed, while immunization with PmpG, or Pgp3, elicited weaker immune responses. Weaker immune responses were induced with MOMP+Pgp3 compared with MOMP alone. Following the intranasal challenge with C. muridarum, mice vaccinated with MOMP showed robust protection against body-weight loss, inflammatory responses in the lungs and number of Chlamydia recovered from the lungs. PmpG and Pgp3 elicited weaker protective responses. Mice immunized with MOMP+PmpG, were no better protected than animals vaccinated with MOMP only, while Pgp3 antagonized the protection elicited by MOMP. In conclusion, PmpG and Pgp3 elicited limited protective immune responses in mice against a respiratory challenge with C. muridarum and failed to enhance the protection induced by MOMP alone. The virulence of Pgp3 may result from its antagonistic effect on the immune protection induced by MOMP.

<title>Abstract</title>  <sec>  <label/>  <p>  The model pennate diatom  <styled-content style='fixed-case'>  <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>  </styled-content>  is able to assimilate a range of iron sources. It therefore provides a platform to study different mechanisms of iron processing concomitantly in the same cell. In this study, we follow the localization of three iron starvation induced proteins (ISIPs) in vivo, driven by their native promoters and tagged by fluorophores in an engineered line of  <styled-content style='fixed-case'>  <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>  </styled-content>  . We find that the localization patterns of ISIPs are dynamic and variable depending on the overall iron status of the cell and the source of iron it is exposed to. Notwithstanding, a shared destination of the three ISIPs both under ferric iron and siderophore‐bound iron supplementation is a globular compartment in the vicinity of the chloroplast. In a proteomic analysis, we identify that the cell engages endocytosis machinery involved in the vesicular trafficking as a response to siderophore molecules, even when these are not bound to iron. Our results suggest that there may be a direct vesicle traffic connection between the diatom cell membrane and the periplastidial compartment (PPC) that co‐opts clathrin‐mediated endocytosis and the “cytoplasm to vacuole” (Cvt) pathway, for proteins involved in iron assimilation.  </p>  <p>Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021172.</p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>Highlight</title>  <p>  The marine diatom  <styled-content style='fixed-case'>  <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>  </styled-content>  engages a vesicular network to traffic siderophores and phytotransferrin from the cell membrane directly to a putative iron processing site in the vicinity of the chloroplast.  </p>  </sec>	Kazamia, Elena|Mach, Jan|McQuaid, Jeffrey B.|Gao, Xia|Coale, Tyler H.|Malych, Ronald|Camadro, Jean‐Michel|Lesuisse, Emmanuel|Allen, Andrew E.|Bowler, Chris|Sutak, Robert	INSERM Université PSL  Paris France/Institut de Biologie de l'ENS (IBENS)/Kazamia, Elena|INSERM Université PSL  Paris France/Institut de Biologie de l'ENS (IBENS)/Gao, Xia|INSERM Université PSL  Paris France/Institut de Biologie de l'ENS (IBENS)/Bowler, Chris|Faculty of Science Charles University  Vestec Czech Republic/Department of Parasitology/Mach, Jan|Faculty of Science Charles University  Vestec Czech Republic/Department of Parasitology/Malych, Ronald|Faculty of Science Charles University  Vestec Czech Republic/Department of Parasitology/Sutak, Robert|The Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research  Bremerhaven Germany/Microbial and Environmental Genomics J.

Filamentous fungi drive carbon and nutrient cycling across our global ecosystems, through its interactions with growing and decaying flora and their constituent microbiomes. The remarkable metabolic diversity, secretion ability, and fiber-like mycelial structure that have evolved in filamentous fungi have been increasingly exploited in commercial operations. The industrial potential of mycelial fermentation ranges from the discovery and bioproduction of enzymes and bioactive compounds, the decarbonization of food and material production, to environmental remediation and enhanced agricultural production. Despite its fundamental impact in ecology and biotechnology, molds and mushrooms have not, to-date, significantly intersected with synthetic biology in ways comparable to other industrial cell factories (e.g. Escherichia coli,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Komagataella phaffii). In this review, we summarize a suite of synthetic biology and computational tools for the mining, engineering and optimization of filamentous fungi as a bioproduction chassis. A combination of methods across genetic engineering, mutagenesis, experimental evolution, and computational modeling can be used to address strain development bottlenecks in established and emerging industries. These include slow mycelium growth rate, low production yields, non-optimal growth in alternative feedstocks, and difficulties in downstream purification. In the scope of biomanufacturing, we then detail previous efforts in improving key bottlenecks by targeting protein processing and secretion pathways, hyphae morphogenesis, and transcriptional control. Bringing synthetic biology practices into the hidden world of molds and mushrooms will serve to expand the limited panel of host organisms that allow for commercially-feasible and environmentally-sustainable bioproduction of enzymes, chemicals, therapeutics, foods, and materials of the future.

The decarbonization of the chemical industry and a shift toward circular economies because of high global CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions make CO<sub>2</sub> an attractive feedstock for manufacturing chemicals. Moreover, H<sub>2</sub> is a low-cost and carbon-free reductant because technologies such as solar-driven electrolysis and supercritical water (scH<sub>2</sub>O) gasification enable sustainable production of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). We review the recent advances in engineering Ralstonia eutropha, the representative species of ""Knallgas"" bacteria, for utilizing CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub> to autotrophically produce 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO). This assessment is focused on state-of-the-art approaches for splitting H<sub>2</sub> to supply energy in the form of ATP and NADH to power cellular reactions and employing the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Major challenges and opportunities for application and future perspectives are discussed in the context of developing other promising CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>-utilizing microorganisms, exemplified by Zymomonas mobilis.

Carbon-neutral production of valuable bioproducts is critical to sustainable development but remains limited by the slow engineering of photosynthetic organisms. Improving existing synthetic biology tools to engineer model organisms to fix carbon dioxide is one route to overcoming the limitations of photosynthetic organisms. In this work, we describe a pipeline that enabled the deletion of a conditionally essential gene from the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 genome. S. oneidensis is a simple bacterial host that could be used for electricity-driven conversion of carbon dioxide in the future with further genetic engineering. We used Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to model carbon and energy flows in central metabolism and assess the effects of single and double gene deletions. We modeled the growth of deletion strains under several alternative conditions to identify substrates that restore viability to an otherwise lethal gene knockout. These predictions were tested in vivo using a Mobile-CRISPRi gene knockdown system. The information learned from FBA and knockdown experiments informed our strategy for gene deletion, allowing us to successfully delete an “expected essential” gene, gpmA. FBA predicted, knockdown experiments supported, and deletion confirmed that the “essential” gene gpmA is not needed for survival, dependent on the medium used. Removal of gpmA is a first step toward driving electrode-powered CO<sub>2</sub> fixation via RuBisCO. This work demonstrates the potential for broadening the scope of genetic engineering in S. oneidensis as a synthetic biology chassis. Furthermore, by combining computational analysis with a CRISPRi knockdown system in this way, one can systematically assess the impact of conditionally essential genes and use this knowledge to generate mutations previously thought unachievable.

The strategy of synergistic application of biological and chemical catalysis is an important approach for efficiently converting renewable biomass into chemicals and fuels. In particular, the method of determining the appropriate intermediate between the two catalytic methods is critical. In this work, we demonstrate p-cymene production through the integration of biosynthesis and heterogenous catalysis and show how a preferred biologically derived precursor could be determined. On the biological side, we performed the limonene and 1,8-cineole production through the mevalonate pathway. Titers of 0.605 g/L and a 1.052 g/L were achieved, respectively. This difference is in agreement with the toxicity of these compounds toward the producing microorganisms, which has implications for subsequent development of the microbial platform. On the heterogeneous catalysis side, we performed the reaction with both biological precursors to allow for direct comparison. Using hydrogenation/dehydrogenation metals on supports with acid sites, both limonene and 1,8-cineole were converted to p-cymene with similar yields under equivalent reaction conditions. Thus, we could determine that the most promising strategy would be to target 1,8-cineole, the higher titer and lower toxicity bio-derived precursor with subsequent catalytic conversion to p-cymene. We further optimized the biological production of 1,8-cineole via fed-batch fermentation and reached the titer of 4.37 g/L which is the highest known 1,8-cineole titer from microbial production. This work provides a valuable paradigm for early stage considerations to determine the best route for the high-efficiency production of a target biobased molecule using an integration of biology and chemistry.

Proper regulation of the bacterial cell envelope is critical for cell survival. Identification and characterization of enzymes that maintain cell envelope homeostasis is crucial, as they can be targets for effective antibiotics. In this study, we have identified a novel enzyme, called EstG, whose activity protects cells from a variety of lethal assaults in the α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Despite homology to transpeptidase family cell wall enzymes and an ability to protect against cell-wall-targeting antibiotics, EstG does not demonstrate biochemical activity toward cell wall substrates. Instead, EstG is genetically connected to the periplasmic enzymes OpgH and BglX, responsible for synthesis and hydrolysis of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs), respectively. The crystal structure of EstG revealed similarities to esterases and transesterases, and we demonstrated esterase activity of EstG in vitro. Using biochemical fractionation, we identified a cyclic hexamer of glucose as a likely substrate of EstG. Further, this molecule is the first OPG described in Caulobacter and establishes a novel class of OPGs, the regulation and modification of which are important for stress survival and adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our data indicate that EstG, BglX, and OpgH comprise a previously unknown OPG pathway in Caulobacter. Ultimately, we propose that EstG is a novel enzyme that instead of acting on the cell wall, acts on cyclic OPGs to provide resistance to a variety of cellular stresses.

Control of gene expression is fundamental to cell engineering. Here we demonstrate a set of approaches to tune gene expression in Clostridia using the model Clostridium phytofermentans. Initially, we develop a simple benchtop electroporation method that we use to identify a set of replicating plasmids and resistance markers that can be cotransformed into C. phytofermentans. We define a series of promoters spanning a >100-fold expression range by testing a promoter library driving the expression of a luminescent reporter. By insertion of tet operator sites upstream of the reporter, its expression can be quantitatively altered using the Tet repressor and anhydrotetracycline (aTc). Furthermore, we integrate these methods into an aTc-regulated dCas12a system with which we show in vivo CRISPRi-mediated repression of reporter and fermentation genes in C. phytofermentans. Together, these approaches advance genetic transformation and experimental control of gene expression in Clostridia.

Glycolysis is an ancient, widespread, and highly conserved metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. In the canonical pathway, the phosphofructokinase (PFK) reaction plays an important role in controlling flux through the pathway. Clostridium thermocellum has an atypical glycolysis and uses pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) instead of ATP as the phosphate donor for the PFK reaction. The reduced thermodynamic driving force of the PP<sub>i</sub>-PFK reaction shifts the entire pathway closer to thermodynamic equilibrium, which has been predicted to limit product titers. Here, in this study, we replace the PP<sub>i</sub>-PFK reaction with an ATP-PFK reaction. We demonstrate that the local changes are consistent with thermodynamic predictions: the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate increases, and the reverse flux through the reaction (determined by <sup>13</sup>C labeling) decreases. The final titer and distribution of fermentation products, however, do not change, demonstrating that the thermodynamic constraints of the PP<sub>i</sub>-PFK reaction are not the sole factor limiting product titer.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  5‐Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) is a pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP)‐dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate‐limiting step of heme biosynthesis in α‐proteobacteria and several non‐plant eukaryotes. All ALAS homologs contain a highly conserved catalytic core, but eukaryotes also have a unique C‐terminal extension that plays a role in enzyme regulation. Several mutations in this region are implicated in multiple blood disorders in humans. In  <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>  ALAS (Hem1), the C‐terminal extension wraps around the homodimer core to contact conserved ALAS motifs proximal to the opposite active site. To determine the importance of these Hem1 C‐terminal interactions, we determined the crystal structure of  <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>  Hem1 lacking the terminal 14 amino acids (Hem1 ΔCT). With truncation of the C‐terminal extension, we show structurally and biochemically that multiple catalytic motifs become flexible, including an antiparallel β‐sheet important to Fold‐Type I PLP‐dependent enzymes. The changes in protein conformation result in an altered cofactor microenvironment, decreased enzyme activity and catalytic efficiency, and ablation of subunit cooperativity. These findings suggest that the eukaryotic ALAS C‐terminus has a homolog‐specific role in mediating heme biosynthesis, indicating a mechanism for autoregulation that can be exploited to allosterically modulate heme biosynthesis in different organisms.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4600		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d13		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1962894		1962894	Protein Science	Journal Article			The yeast  <scp>ALA</scp>  synthase C‐terminus positively controls enzyme structure and function									
<title>SUMMARY</title>  <p>From the perspectives of pathway evolution, discovery and engineering of plant specialized metabolism, the nature of the biosynthetic routes represents a critical aspect. Classical models depict biosynthesis typically from an end‐point angle and as linear, for example, connecting central and specialized metabolism. As the number of functionally elucidated routes increased, the enzymatic foundation of complex plant chemistries became increasingly well understood. The perception of linear pathway models has been severely challenged. With a focus on plant terpenoid specialized metabolism, we review here illustrative examples supporting that plants have evolved complex networks driving chemical diversification. The completion of several diterpene, sesquiterpene and monoterpene routes shows complex formation of scaffolds and their subsequent functionalization. These networks show that branch points, including multiple sub‐routes, mean that metabolic grids are the rule rather than the exception. This concept presents significant implications for biotechnological production.</p>	Lanier, Emily R.|Andersen, Trine Bundgaard|Hamberger, Björn	1066 Bogue Street East Lansing Michigan 48824 USA/Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Michigan State University  Molecular Plant Sciences Building/Lanier, Emily R.|1066 Bogue Street East Lansing Michigan 48824 USA/Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Michigan State University  Molecular Plant Sciences Building/Andersen, Trine Bundgaard|1066 Bogue Street East Lansing Michigan 48824 USA/Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Michigan State University  Molecular Plant Sciences Building/Hamberger, Björn			1066 Bogue Street East Lansing Michigan 48824 USA	e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.16177		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d14		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1963728	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Michigan State University  Molecular Plant Sciences Building	1963728	The Plant Journal	Journal Article	2023-03-29T00:00:00Z	2023	Plant terpene specialized metabolism: complex networks or simple linear pathways?									
<p>  Proteomic methods have been widely used to study proteins in complex biological samples to understand biological molecular mechanisms. Most well-established methods (known as bottom-up proteomics, BUP) employ an enzymatic digestion step to cleave intact proteins into smaller peptides for liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS) detection. In contrast, top-down proteomics (TDP) directly characterizes intact proteins including all possible post-translational modifications (PTMs), thus offering unique insights into proteoform biology where combinations of individual PTMs may play important roles. We performed TDP on soybean root nodules infected by the symbiotic  <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>  in both the wildtype bacterium and a  <italic>nifH-</italic>  mutant, which lacks the ability to fix nitrogen in the soybean root nodule. TDP captured 1648 proteoforms derived from 313 bacterial genes and 178 soybean genes. Leghemoglobin, the most abundant protein in the sample, existed in many truncated proteoforms. Interestingly, these truncated proteoforms were considerably more abundant in the wildtype relative to the  <italic>nifH-</italic>  mutant, implicating protease activity as an important factor in nitrogen fixation. Proteoforms with various PTMs and combinations thereof were identified using an unrestricted open modification search. This included less common PTMs such as myristoylation, palmitoylation, cyanylation, and sulfation. In parallel, we collected high resolution MS imaging (MSI) data of intact proteins and biopolymers (&lt;20 kDa due to current technical limitations) from sections of the soybean root nodules using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) coupled to high resolution Orbitrap. Several detected proteoforms exhibited unique spatial distributions inside the infection zone and cortex, suggesting functional compartmentalization in these regions. A subset of peaks from the MALDI-MSI were assigned to proteoforms detected in TDP LCMS data based on matching accurate masses. Many of the proteins detected in both LCMS and MALDI-MSI are currently uncharacterized in UniProt: the PTM and spatial information presented here will be valuable in understanding their biological functions. Taken together, our study demonstrates how untargeted TDP approach can provide unique insights into plant proteoform biology. On-going technology developments are expected to further improve TDP coverage for more comprehensive high-throughput analysis of proteoforms.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.3389/frans.2022.1012707		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d15		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890547		1890547	Frontiers in Analytical Science	Journal Article			Discovery top-down proteomics in symbiotic soybean root nodules									
Lactones are prevalent in biological and industrial settings, yet there is a lack of information regarding enzymes used to metabolize these compounds. One compound, γ-valerolactone (GVL), is used as a solvent to dissolve plant cell walls into sugars and aromatic molecules for subsequent microbial conversion to fuels and chemicals. Despite the promise of GVL as a renewable solvent for biomass deconstruction, residual GVL can be toxic to microbial fermentation. Here, we identified a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Rpa3624) and showed that it can hydrolyze aliphatic and aromatic lactones and esters, including GVL. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of other related lactonases with experimentally determined substrate preferences shows that Rpa3624 separates by sequence motifs into a subclade with preference for hydrophobic substrates. Additionally, we solved crystal structures of this β-propeller enzyme separately with either phosphate, an inhibitor, or a mixture of GVL and products to define an active site where calcium-bound water and calcium-bound aspartic and glutamic acid residues make close contact with substrate and product. Our kinetic characterization of WT and mutant enzymes combined with structural insights inform a reaction mechanism that centers around activation of a calcium-bound water molecule promoted by general base catalysis and close contacts with substrate and a potential intermediate. Similarity of Rpa3624 with other β-propeller lactonases suggests this mechanism may be relevant for other members of this emerging class of versatile catalysts.

Clostridium thermocellum is a cellulolytic thermophile that is considered for the consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose to ethanol. Improvements in ethanol yield are required for industrial implementation, but the incompletely understood causes of amino acid secretion impede progress. In this study, amino acid secretion was investigated via gene deletions in ammonium-regulated, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-supplying and NADPH-consuming pathways as well as via physiological characterization in cellobiose-limited or ammonium-limited chemostats. First, the contribution of the NADPH-supplying malate shunt was studied with strains using either the NADPH-yielding malate shunt (Δppdk) or a redox-independent conversion of PEP to pyruvate (Δppdk ΔmalE::P<sub>eno</sub>-pyk). In the latter, branched-chain amino acids, especially valine, were significantly reduced, whereas the ethanol yield increased from 46 to 60%, suggesting that the secretion of these amino acids balances the NADPH surplus from the malate shunt. The unchanged amino acid secretion in Δppdk falsified a previous hypothesis on an ammonium-regulated PEP-to-pyruvate flux redistribution. The possible involvement of another NADPH-supplier, namely, NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase (nfnAB), was also excluded. Finally, the deletion of glutamate synthase (gogat) in ammonium assimilation resulted in the upregulation of NADPH-linked glutamate dehydrogenase activity and decreased amino acid yields. Since gogat in C. thermocellum is putatively annotated as ferredoxin-linked, a claim which is supported by the product redistribution observed in this study, this deletion likely replaced ferredoxin with NADPH in ammonium assimilation. Overall, these findings indicate that a need to reoxidize NADPH is driving the observed amino acid secretion, likely at the expense of the NADH needed for ethanol formation. This suggests that metabolic engineering strategies that simplify the redox metabolism and ammonium assimilation can contribute to increased ethanol yields.

Protein S-glutathionylation (SSG) is a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) featuring the conjugation of glutathione to a protein cysteine thiol. SSG can alter protein structure, activity, subcellular localization, and interaction with small molecules and other proteins. Thus, it plays a critical role in redox signaling and regulation in various physiological activities and pathological events. In this review, we summarize current biochemical and analytical approaches for characterizing SSG at both the proteome level and at individual protein levels. To illustrate the mechanism underlying SSG-mediated redox regulation, we highlight recent examples of functional and structural consequences of SSG modifications. Finally, we discuss the analytical challenges in characterizing SSG and the thiol PTM landscape, future directions for understanding of the role of SSG in redox signaling and regulation and its interplay with other PTMs, and the potential role of computational approaches to accelerate functional discovery.

Developing in silico models that accurately reflect a whole, functional cell is an ongoing challenge in biology. Current efforts bring together mathematical models, probabilistic models, visual representations, and data to create a multi-scale description of cellular processes. A realistic whole-cell model requires imaging data since it provides spatial constraints and other critical cellular characteristics that are still impossible to obtain by calculation alone. This review introduces Soft X-ray Tomography (SXT) as a powerful imaging technique to visualize and quantify the mesoscopic (~25 nm spatial scale) organelle landscape in whole cells. SXT generates three-dimensional reconstructions of cellular ultrastructure and provides a measured structural framework for whole-cell modeling. Combining SXT with data from disparate technologies at varying spatial resolutions provides further biochemical details and constraints for modeling cellular mechanisms. We conclude, based on the results discussed here, that SXT provides a foundational dataset for a broad spectrum of whole-cell modeling experiments.

To meet the ever-increasing need for high-throughput screening in metabolic engineering, information-rich, fast screening methods are needed. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides an efficient and general approach for metabolite screening and offers the capability of characterizing a broad range of analytes in a label-free manner, but often requires a range of sample clean-up and extraction steps. Liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) coupled MS is an image-guided MS surface analysis approach that directly samples and introduces metabolites from a surface to MS. Here, we combined the advantages of LESA–MS and an acoustic liquid handler with stable isotope-labeled internal standards. This approach provides absolute quantitation of target chemicals from liquid culture-dried droplets and enables high-throughput quantitative screening for microbial metabolites. In this paper, LESA–MS was successfully applied to quantify several different metabolites (itaconic acid, triacetic acid lactone, and palmitic acid) from different yeast strains in different mediums, demonstrating its versatility, accuracy, and efficiency across a range of microbial engineering applications.

Methanococcus is a genus of well-characterized mesophilic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens with a robust genetic system. Commonly found in tidal marshes, they compete with sulfate- and iron-reducing bacteria for hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and formate, their two major energy sources. They are characterized by rapid growth in mineral medium and requirements for marine levels of salts for optimal growth.  Genetic tools developed over the last twenty years include improvements in shuttle vectors for production of recombinant proteins and CRISPR systems for mutagenesis as well as a variety of marker proteins for studies of gene expression. These tools have enabled functional characterization of the genome, including regulation of the transcriptome and proteome, mapping of transcription start and termination sites, and identification of essential genes. Metabolic and gene regulatory network models have been created. This foundation in the basic biology of Methanococcus provides an opportunity for development of biotechnological applications of these hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Life on earth depends on photosynthetic primary producers that exploit sunlight to fix CO<sub>2</sub> into biomass. Approximately half of global primary production is associated with microalgae living in aquatic environments. Microalgae also represent a promising source of biomass to complement crop cultivation, and they could contribute to the development of a more sustainable bioeconomy. Photosynthetic organisms evolved multiple mechanisms involved in the regulation of photosynthesis to respond to highly variable environmental conditions. While essential to avoid photodamage, regulation of photosynthesis results in dissipation of absorbed light energy, generating a complex trade-off between protection from stress and light-use efficiency. Here, this work investigates the impact of the xanthophyll cycle, the light-induced reversible conversion of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin, on the protection from excess light and on biomass productivity in the marine microalgae of the genus Nannochloropsis. Zeaxanthin is shown to have an essential role in protection from excess light, contributing to the induction of nonphotochemical quenching and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. On the contrary, the overexpression of zeaxanthin epoxidase enables a faster reconversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin that is shown to be advantageous for biomass productivity in dense cultures in photobioreactors. These results demonstrate that zeaxanthin accumulation is critical to respond to strong illumination, but it may lead to unnecessary energy losses in light-limiting conditions and accelerating its reconversion to violaxanthin provides an advantage for biomass productivity in microalgae.						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2214119120		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d1d		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1984704		1984704	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Journal Article			Modulation of xanthophyll cycle impacts biomass productivity in the marine microalga <em>Nannochloropsis</em>									
Bacteria remodel their plasma membrane lipidome to maintain key biophysical attributes in response to ecological disturbances. For Halanaerobium and other anaerobic halotolerant taxa that persist in hydraulically fractured deep subsurface shale reservoirs, salinity, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are important perturbants of cell membrane structure, yet their effects remain poorly understood. Membrane-linked activities underlie in situ microbial growth kinetics and physiologies which drive biogeochemical reactions in engineered subsurface systems. Hence, we used gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to investigate the effects of salinity and HRT on the phospholipid fatty acid composition of H. congolense WG10 and mixed enrichment cultures from hydraulically fractured shale wells. We also coupled acyl chain remodeling to membrane mechanics by measuring bilayer elasticity using atomic force microscopy (AFM). For these experiments, cultures were grown in a chemostat vessel operated in continuous flow mode under strict anoxia and constant stirring. Our findings show that salinity and HRT induce significant changes in membrane fatty acid chemistry of H. congolense WG10 in distinct and complementary ways. Notably, under nonoptimal salt concentrations (7% and 20% NaCl), H. congolense WG10 elevates the portion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in its membrane, and this results in an apparent increase in fluidity (homeoviscous adaptation principle) and thickness. Double bond index (DBI) and mean chain length (MCL) were used as proxies for membrane fluidity and thickness, respectively. These results provide new insight into our understanding of how environmental and engineered factors might disrupt the physical and biogeochemical equilibria of fractured shale by inducing physiologically relevant changes in the membrane fatty acid chemistry of persistent microbial taxa.

Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to value-added products presents an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions while generating revenue. Formate, which can be generated by the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>, has been proposed as a promising intermediate compound for microbial upgrading. Here we present progress towards improving the soil bacterium Cupriavidus necator H16, which is capable of growing on formate as its sole source of carbon and energy using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, as a host for formate utilization. Using adaptive laboratory evolution, we generated several isolates that exhibited faster growth rates on formate. The genomes of these isolates were sequenced, and resulting mutations were systematically reintroduced by metabolic engineering, to identify those that improved growth. Further, the metabolic impact of several mutations was investigated further using RNA-seq transcriptomics. We found that deletion of a transcriptional regulator implicated in quorum sensing, PhcA, reduced expression of several operons and led to improved growth on formate. Growth was also improved by deleting large genomic regions present on the extrachromosomal megaplasmid pHG1, particularly two hydrogenase operons and the megaplasmid CBB operon, one of two copies present in the genome. Based on these findings, we generated a rationally engineered ..delta..phcA and megaplasmid-deficient strain that exhibited a 24% faster maximum growth rate on formate. Moreover, this strain achieved a 7% growth rate improvement on succinate and a 19% increase on fructose, demonstrating the broad utility of microbial genome reduction. This strain has the potential to serve as an improved microbial chassis for biological conversion of formate to value-added products.

Enzymatic deconstruction of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is under intense investigation, given the ability of hydrolase enzymes to depolymerize PET to its constituent monomers near the polymer glass transition temperature. To date, reported PET hydrolases have been sourced from a relatively narrow sequence space. Here, we identify additional PET-active biocatalysts from natural diversity by using bioinformatics and machine learning to mine 74 putative thermotolerant PET hydrolases. We successfully express, purify, and assay 51 enzymes from seven distinct phylogenetic groups; observing PET hydrolysis activity on amorphous PET film from 37 enzymes in reactions spanning pH from 4.5–9.0 and temperatures from 30–70 °C. We conduct PET hydrolysis time-course reactions with the best-performing enzymes, where we observe differences in substrate selectivity as function of PET morphology. We employed X-ray crystallography and AlphaFold to examine the enzyme architectures of all 74 candidates, revealing protein folds and accessory domains not previously associated with PET deconstruction. Overall, this study expands the number and diversity of thermotolerant scaffolds for enzymatic PET deconstruction.	Erickson, Erika|Gado, Japheth E.	United States/National Renewable Energy Lab.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Eukaryotic life benefits from—and ofttimes critically relies upon—the de novo biosynthesis and supply of vitamins and micronutrients from bacteria. The micronutrient queuosine (Q), derived from diet and/or the gut microbiome, is used as a source of the nucleobase queuine, which once incorporated into the anticodon of tRNA contributes to translational efficiency and accuracy. Here, we report high-resolution, substrate-bound crystal structures of the Sphaerobacter thermophilus queuine salvage protein Qng1 (formerly DUF2419) and of its human ortholog QNG1 (C9orf64), which together with biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate its function as the hydrolase releasing queuine from queuosine-5′-monophosphate as the biological substrate. We also show that QNG1 is highly expressed in the liver, with implications for Q salvage and recycling. The essential role of this family of hydrolases in supplying queuine in eukaryotes places it at the nexus of numerous (patho)physiological processes associated with queuine deficiency, including altered metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and cancer progression.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1231		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d23		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1908287		1908287	Nucleic Acids Research	Journal Article			Structural basis of Qng1-mediated salvage of the micronutrient queuine from queuosine-5′-monophosphate as the biological substrate									
The human gut microbiome, which develops and stabilizes during the early stages of infant life, plays an essential role in host health through the production of metabolic resources and the stimulation and training of the immune system. To study colonization and community functional dynamics of the microbiota based on responses to host immune processes during the normal and dysbiotic establishment of the gut, metaproteomics was conducted on 91 fecal samples collected over the first 90 days of life from 17 hospitalized premature infants. Microbial responses to antibiotic administration and host-imposed metal bactericidal control correlated with community assembly and resiliency of microbes in the developing preterm gut. Specifically, proteins related to antibiotic resistance and metal homeostasis mechanisms were predominant in persisting members in the infant gut environment over the first several weeks of life. Overall, this metaproteomics study provides a unique approach to examine the temporal expansion and resilience of microbial colonization, as it allows simultaneous examination of both host and microbial metabolic activities. Understanding the interplay between host and microbes may elucidate the microbiome’s potential immunomodulatory roles relevant to necrotizing enterocolitis and other dysbiotic conditions in preterm infants.

Gated entry of lipophilic ligands into the enclosed hydrophobic pocket in stand-alone Sec14 domain proteins often links lipid metabolism to membrane trafficking. Similar domains occur in multidomain mammalian proteins that activate small GTPases and regulate actin dynamics. The neuronal RhoGEF Kalirin, a central regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, contains a Sec14 domain (Kal<sup>bSec14</sup>) followed by multiple spectrin-like repeats and catalytic domains. Previous studies demonstrated that Kalirin lacking its Sec14 domain fails to maintain cell morphology or dendritic spine length, yet whether and how Kal<sup>bSec14</sup> interacts with lipids remain unknown. Here, we report the structural and biochemical characterization of Kal<sup>bSec14</sup>. Kal<sup>bSec14</sup> adopts a closed conformation, sealing off the canonical ligand entry site, and instead employs a surface groove to bind a limited set of lysophospholipids. The low-affinity interactions of Kal<sup>bSec14</sup> with lysolipids are expected to serve as a general model for the regulation of Rho signaling by other Sec14-containing Rho activators.

<p>  <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>  (group A  <italic>Streptococcus</italic>  ) is a clinically important microbial pathogen that requires iron in order to proliferate. During infections,  <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>  uses the surface displayed Shr receptor to capture human hemoglobin (Hb) and acquires its iron-laden heme molecules. Through a poorly understood mechanism, Shr engages Hb via two structurally unique N-terminal Hb-interacting domains (HID1 and HID2) which facilitate heme transfer to proximal NEAr Transporter (NEAT) domains. Based on the results of X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, native mass spectrometry, and heme transfer experiments, we propose that Shr utilizes a “cap and release” mechanism to gather heme from Hb. In the mechanism, Shr uses the HID1 and HID2 modules to preferentially recognize only heme-loaded forms of Hb by contacting the edges of its protoporphyrin rings. Heme transfer is enabled by significant receptor dynamics within the Shr–Hb complex which function to transiently uncap HID1 from the heme bound to Hb’s β subunit, enabling the gated release of its relatively weakly bound heme molecule and subsequent capture by Shr’s NEAT domains. These dynamics may maximize the efficiency of heme scavenging by  <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>  , enabling it to preferentially recognize and remove heme from only heme-loaded forms of Hb that contain iron.  </p>	Macdonald, Ramsay|Mahoney, Brendan J.|Soule, Jess|Goring, Andrew K.|Ford, Jordan|Loo, Joseph A.|Cascio, Duilio|Clubb, Robert T.

The last steps of cellular respiration—an essential metabolic process in plants—are carried out by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves a chain of multi-subunit membrane protein complexes (complexes I–V) that form higher-order assemblies called supercomplexes. Although supercomplexes are the most physiologically relevant form of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, their functions and structures remain mostly unknown. Here we present the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the supercomplex I + III<sub>2</sub> from Vigna radiata (mung bean). The structure contains the full subunit complement of complex I, including a newly assigned, plant-specific subunit. It also shows differences in the mitochondrial processing peptidase domain of complex III<sub>2</sub> relative to a previously determined supercomplex with complex IV. The supercomplex interface, while reminiscent of that in other organisms, is plant specific, with a major interface involving complex III<sub>2</sub>’s mitochondrial processing peptidase domain and no participation of complex I’s bridge domain. The complex I structure suggests that the bridge domain sets the angle between the enzyme’s two arms, limiting large-scale conformational changes. Moreover, complex I’s catalytic loops and its response in active-to-deactive assays suggest that, in V. radiata, the resting complex adopts a non-canonical state and can sample deactive- or open-like conformations even in the presence of substrate. This study widens our understanding of the possible conformations and behaviour of complex I and supercomplex I + III<sub>2</sub>. Further studies of complex I and its supercomplexes in diverse organisms are needed to determine the universal and clade-specific mechanisms of respiration.	Maldonado, Maria|Fan, Z.|Abe, K.

<p>Bacterial cell walls are the guards of cell integrity. They are composed of peptidoglycan that provides rigidity to sustain internal turgor and ensures isolation from the external environment. In addition, they harbor the enzymatic machinery to secure cell wall modulations needed throughout the bacterial lifespan. The main players in this process are peptidoglycan hydrolases, a large group of enzymes with diverse specificities and different mechanisms of action. They are commonly, but not exclusively, found in prokaryotes. Although in most cases, these enzymes share the same molecular function, namely peptidoglycan hydrolysis, they are leveraged to perform a variety of physiological roles. A well-investigated family of peptidoglycan hydrolases is M23 peptidases, which display a very conserved fold, but their spectrum of lytic action is broad and includes both Gram- positive and Gram- negative bacteria. In this review, we summarize the structural, biochemical, and functional studies concerning the M23 family of peptidases based on literature and complement this knowledge by performing large-scale analyses of available protein sequences. This review has led us to gain new insight into the role of surface charge in the activity of this group of enzymes. We present relevant conclusions drawn from the analysis of available structures and indicate the main structural features that play a crucial role in specificity determination and mechanisms of latency. Our work systematizes the knowledge of the M23 family enzymes in the context of their unique antimicrobial potential against drug-resistant pathogens and presents possibilities to modulate and engineer their features to develop perfect antibacterial weapons.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1036964		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d28		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894151		1894151	Frontiers in Microbiology	Journal Article			One fold, many functions—M23 family of peptidoglycan hydrolases									
We report the useful applications of plastics are as significant as the problems associated with their disposal. Current waste management strategies are ineffective at preventing the flow of plastics into landfills, wastewater treatment, and the environment. Despite the importance of recycling technologies, most plastics are used for consumables and are discarded after limited usage. Moreover, only certain plastics are recycled, and those that are generally yield lower value products. Discovering alternative routes for valorizing plastic wastes is essential. Emerging research involves the use of biocatalysts (i.e., enzymes and microorganisms) to produce valuable products like specialty polymers, biosurfactants, and drug precursors from these feedstocks. These bioprocesses commonly integrate physio-chemical pretreatments (to generate biologically reactive intermediates) and biological upgrading (to convert intermediates to products). Herein, publications that explore plastic deconstruction technologies and bioprocesses are reviewed with an emphasis on plastic waste valorization. Understanding how microorganisms metabolize the intermediates of plastic degradation and manage their inhibitory effects is a prerequisite for engineering bioprocesses. For these heterogeneous wastes, a paradigm shift from axenic cultivation of microorganisms to cultivation of microbial consortia may benefit conversion efficiency and stress resilience. Thus, a summary is provided for metabolic pathways and constituent enzymes required to synthesize biofuels, biomaterials, and chemicals from biologically reactive intermediates. Colossal challenges associated with the use of plastics as feedstocks for direct biological processing highlight the need for integrating physical, chemical, and biological technologies.

Previously, we had demonstrated that Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157) strain 86–24 expresses proteins involved in survival rather than virulence in vitro in rumen fluid from dairy cattle limit fed a maintenance diet. Here, we verified if this observation would be true for different O157 strains grown in vitro in rumen fluid from, and in vivo in the rumen of, animals on contrasting maintenance (high fiber) and lactation (high energy-protein) diets usually limit fed to dairy cattle. For the in vivo studies, an economical, novel, reusable and non-terminal rumen-fistulated animal model permitting simultaneous evaluation of multiple bacterial strains in the bovine rumen was developed. All experiments were conducted in duplicate using different animals to account for host-related variations. The O157 strains included, 86–24, EDL933 and the super shed SS-17. E. coli Nal<sup>R</sup> (#5735), derived from a bovine intestinal commensal E. coli, was included as a control. As expected, diet influenced ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid (VFA) composition. The pH ranged from 6.2–7.0 and total VFA concentrations from 109–141 μM/ml, in animals fed the maintenance diet. In comparison, animals fed the lactation diet had a ruminal pH ranging between 5.18–6.0, and total VFA of 125–219 μM/ml. Strain dependent differences in O157 recovery from the rumen fluid of cattle fed either diet was observed, both in vitro and in vivo, with O157 strains 86–24 and EDL933 demonstrating similar survival patterns. Analysis of the O157 proteomes expressed in the rumen fluid/rumen verified previous observations of adaptive responses. Any difference in the adaptive response was mainly influenced by the animal’s diet and growth conditions (in vitro and in vivo) and not the O157 strain. These new insights into the O157 responses could help formulate modalities to control O157 across strains in cattle at all stages of husbandry.

<p>  Understanding how plant pathogenic fungi adapt to their hosts is of critical importance to securing optimal crop productivity. In response to pathogenic attack, plants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of a multipronged defense response. Pathogens, in turn, have evolved ROS scavenging mechanisms to undermine host defense. Thioredoxins (Trx) are highly conserved oxidoreductase enzymes with a dithiol-disulfide active site, and function as antioxidants to protect cells against free radicals, such as ROS. However, the roles of thioredoxins in  <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic>  , an important vascular pathogen, are not clear. Through proteomics analyses, we identified a putative thioredoxin (VdTrx1) lacking a signal peptide. VdTrx1 was present in the exoproteome of  <italic>V. dahliae</italic>  cultured in the presence of host tissues, a finding that suggested that it plays a role in host-pathogen interactions. We constructed a  <italic>VdTrx1</italic>  deletion mutant Δ  <italic>VdTrx1</italic>  that exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to ROS stress, H  <sub>2</sub>  O  <sub>2</sub>  , and  <italic>tert</italic>  -butyl hydroperoxide (  <italic>t</italic>  -BOOH).  <italic>In vivo</italic>  assays by live-cell imaging and  <italic>in vitro</italic>  assays by western blotting revealed that while VdTrx1 lacking the signal peptide can be localized within  <italic>V. dahliae</italic>  cells, VdTrx1 can also be secreted unconventionally depending on VdVps36, a member of the ESCRT-II protein complex. The Δ  <italic>VdTrx1</italic>  strain was unable to scavenge host-generated extracellular ROS fully during host invasion. Deletion of  <italic>VdTrx1</italic>  resulted in higher intracellular ROS levels of  <italic>V. dahliae</italic>  mycelium, displayed impaired conidial production, and showed significantly reduced virulence on  <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>  , and model plants,  <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>  and  <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>  .

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>The maturation pathway for the nickel-dependent enzyme urease utilizes the protein UreE as a metallochaperone to supply Ni(II) ions. In Helicobacter pylori urease maturation also requires HypA and HypB, accessory proteins that are commonly associated with hydrogenase maturation. Herein we report on the characterization of a protein complex formed between HypA and the UreE2 dimer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) coupled with molecular modelling show that the protein complex apo, Zn-HypA•UreE2, forms between the rigorously conserved Met-His-Glu (MHE motif) Ni-binding N-terminal sequence of HypA and the two conserved His102A and His102B located at the dimer interface of UreE2. This complex forms in the absence of Ni(II) and is supported by extensive protein contacts that include the use of the C-terminal sequences of UreE2 to form additional strands of β-sheet with the Ni-binding domain of HypA. The Ni-binding properties of apo, Zn-HypA•UreE2 and the component proteins were investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry using a global fitting strategy that included all of the relevant equilibria, and show that the Ni,Zn-HypA•UreE2 complex contains a single Ni(II)-binding site with a sub-nanomolar KD. The structural features of this novel Ni(II) site were elucidated using proteins produced with specifically deuterated amino acids, protein point mutations, and the analyses of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, hyperfine shifted NMR features, as well as molecular modeling coupled with quantum-mechanical calculations. The results show that the complex contains a six-coordinate, high-spin Ni(II) site with ligands provided by both component proteins.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfad003		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d2c		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961072		1961072	Metallomics (Online)	Journal Article			The structure of the high-affinity nickel-binding site in the Ni,Zn-HypA•UreE2 complex

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Cyanobacteria are new sources of value-added compounds but also ubiquitous and harmful microfoulers on marine biofouling. In this work, the isolation and identification of two cyanobacterial strains isolated from Cape Verde and Morocco, as well as their biofilm-forming ability on glass and Perspex under controlled hydrodynamic conditions, were performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cyanobacterial strains isolated belong to Leptothoe and Jaaginema genera (Leptothoe sp. LEGE 181153 and Jaaginema sp. LEGE 191154). From quantitative and qualitative data of wet weight, chlorophyll a content and biofilm thickness obtained by optical coherence tomography, no significant differences were found in biofilms developed by the same cyanobacterial strain on different surfaces (glass and Perspex). However, the biofilm-forming potential of Leptothoe sp. LEGE 181153 proved to be higher compared with Jaaginema sp. LEGE 191154, particularly at the maturation stage of biofilm development. Three-dimensional biofilm images obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy showed different patterns between both cyanobacterial strains and also among the two surfaces. Because standard methodologies to evaluate cyanobacterial biofilm formation, as well as two different optical imaging techniques, were used, this work also highlights the possibility of integrating different techniques to evaluate a complex phenomenon like cyanobacterial biofilm development.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiad004		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d2f		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961508		1961508	FEMS Microbiology Ecology (Online)	Journal Article			Characterization and biofouling potential analysis of two cyanobacterial strains isolated from Cape Verde and Morocco									
<p>  Accurate genome annotations are essential in modern biology and biotechnology, yet they are still largely based on genome sequencing and comparative analyses. We show that the  <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic>  genome annotation can be markedly improved by integrating bioinformatic predictions with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data. Samples were acquired under butanol, butyrate, and unstressed treatments across various growth conditions. Analysis of an initial assembly revealed errors due to background signals and limitations of assembly algorithms. Hurdles for RNAseq transcriptome mapping include optimizing library complexity and sequencing depth, yet most studies report low sequencing depth and ignore the effect of ribosomal RNA abundance. An integrative analysis was developed to combine motif predictions, single‐nucleotide resolution sequencing depth, and library complexity to resolve difficulties in assembly curation. This minimized false positive error and determined gene boundaries, in some cases, to the exact base‐pair of prior studies. This is the first strand‐specific transcriptome assembly in a  <italic>Clostridium</italic>  organism. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers  <italic>AIChE J</italic>  , 64: 4271–4280, 2018  </p>	Ralston, Matthew T.|Papoutsakis, Eleftherios T.

Tracking the metabolic activity of whole soil communities can improve our understanding of the transformation and fate of carbon in soils. For this work, we used stable isotope metabolomics to trace <sup>13</sup>C from nine labeled carbon sources into the water-soluble metabolite pool of an agricultural soil over time. Soil was amended with a mixture of all nine sources, with one source isotopically labeled in each treatment. We compared changes in the <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of metabolites with respect to carbon source and time over a 48-day incubation and contrasted differences between soluble sources (glucose, xylose, amino acids, etc.) and insoluble sources (cellulose and palmitic acid). Whole soil metabolite profiles varied singularly by time, while the composition of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled metabolites differed primarily by carbon source (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.68) rather than time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.07), with source-specific differences persisting throughout incubations. The <sup>13</sup>C labeling of metabolites from insoluble carbon sources occurred slower than that from soluble sources but yielded a higher average atom percent (atom%) <sup>13</sup>C in metabolite markers of biomass (amino acids and nucleic acids). The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of metabolite markers of biomass stabilized between 5 and 15 atom% <sup>13</sup>C by the end of incubations. Temporal patterns in the <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, nucleobases (uracil and thymine), and by-products of DNA salvage (allantoin) closely tracked microbial activity. Our results demonstrate that metabolite production in soils is driven by the carbon source supplied to the community and that the fate of carbon in metabolites do not generally converge over time as a result of ongoing microbial processing and recycling.

X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) has become a widely used technique for imaging the concentration and distribution of metal ions in cells and tissues. Recent advances in synchrotron sources, optics, and detectors have improved the spatial resolution of the technique to <10 nm with attogram detection sensitivity. However, to make XFM most beneficial for bioimaging - especially at the nanoscale - the metal ion distribution must be visualized within the subcellular context of the cell. Over the years, a number of approaches have been taken to develop X-ray-sensitive tags that permit the visualization of specific organelles or proteins using XFM. In this review, we examine the types of X-ray fluorophore used, including nanomaterials and metal ions, and the approaches used to incorporate the metal into their target binding site via antibodies, genetically encoded metal-binding peptides, affinity labeling, or cell-specific peptides. Here we evaluate their advantages and disadvantages, review the scientific findings, and discuss the needs for future development.	Victor-Lovelace, Tiffany W.|Miller, Lisa M.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>A metabolite of ammonium assimilation was previously theorized to be involved in the coordination of the overall nitrate response in plants. Here we show that 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline, made by transamination of glutamine, the first product of ammonium assimilation, may be involved in signaling a plant’s ammonium assimilation status. In leaves, 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline met four foundational requirements to be such a signal. First, when it was applied to foliage, enzyme activities of nitrate reduction and ammonium assimilation increased; the activities of key tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated enzymes that help to supply carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis also increased. Second, its leaf pools increased as nitrate availability increased. Third, the pool size of its precursor, Gln, reflected ammonium assimilation rather than photorespiration. Fourth, it was widely conserved among monocots, dicots, legumes, and nonlegumes and in plants with C3 or C4 metabolism. Made directly from the first product of ammonium assimilation, 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline acted as a nitrate uptake stimulant. When 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline was provided to roots, the plant’s nitrate uptake rate approximately doubled. Plants exogenously provided with 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline to either roots or leaves accumulated greater biomass. A model was constructed that included the proposed roles of 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline as a signal molecule of ammonium assimilation status in leaves, as a stimulator of nitrate uptake by roots and nitrate downloading from the xylem. In summary, a glutamine metabolite made in the ω-amidase pathway stimulated nitrate uptake by roots and was likely to be a signal of ammonium assimilation status in leaves. A chemical synthesis method for 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline was also developed.</p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiac501		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d33		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1907290		1907290	Plant Physiology (Bethesda)	Journal Article			The intermediate in a nitrate-responsive ω-amidase pathway in plants may signal ammonium assimilation status									
Chlorophyll pigments are used by photosynthetic organisms to facilitate light capture and mediate the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. Due to the indispensable nature of this pigment and its propensity to form reactive oxygen species, organisms heavily invest in its biosynthesis, recycling, and degradation. One key enzyme implicated in these processes is chlorophyllase, an α/β hydrolase that hydrolyzes the phytol tail of chlorophyll pigments to produce chlorophyllide molecules. This enzyme was discovered a century ago, but despite its importance to diverse photosynthetic organisms, there are still many missing biochemical details regarding how chlorophyllase functions. Here, we present the 4.46-Å resolution crystal structure of chlorophyllase from Triticum aestivum. This structure reveals the dimeric architecture of chlorophyllase, the arrangement of catalytic residues, an unexpected divalent metal ion–binding site, and a substrate-binding site that can accommodate a diverse range of pigments. Further, this structure exhibits the existence of both intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds. We investigated the importance of these architectural features using enzyme kinetics, mass spectrometry, and thermal shift assays. Through this work, we demonstrated that the oxidation state of the Cys residues is imperative to the activity and stability of chlorophyllase, illuminating a biochemical trigger for responding to environmental stress. Additional bioinformatics analysis of the chlorophyllase enzyme family reveals widespread conservation of key catalytic residues and the identified “redox switch” among other plant chlorophyllase homologs, thus revealing key details regarding the structure-function relationships in chlorophyllase.

<p>  Root anatomical phenotypes present a promising yet underexploited avenue to deliver major improvements in yield and climate resilience of crops by improving water and nutrient uptake. For instance, the formation of root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) significantly increases soil exploration and resource capture by reducing the metabolic costs of root tissue. A key bottleneck in studying such phenotypes has been the lack of robust high-throughput anatomical phenotyping platforms. We exploited a phenotyping approach based on laser ablation tomography, termed  <italic>Anatomics</italic>  , to quantify variation in RCA formation of 436 diverse maize lines in the field. Results revealed a significant and heritable variation for RCA formation. Genome-wide association studies identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping to a root cortex-expressed gene-encoding transcription factor bHLH121. Functional studies identified that the  <italic>bHLH121</italic>  Mu transposon mutant line and CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function mutant line showed reduced RCA formation, whereas an overexpression line exhibited significantly greater RCA formation when compared to the wild-type line. Characterization of these lines under suboptimal water and nitrogen availability in multiple soil environments revealed that  <italic>bHLH121</italic>  is required for RCA formation developmentally as well as under studied abiotic stress. Overall functional validation of the  <italic>bHLH121</italic>  gene’s importance in RCA formation provides a functional marker to select varieties with improved soil exploration and thus yield under suboptimal conditions.  </p>	Schneider, Hannah M.|Lor, Vai S.|Zhang, Xia|Saengwilai, Patompong|Hanlon, Meredith T.|Klein, Stephanie P.|Davis, Jayne L.|Borkar, Aditi N.|Depew, Cody L.|Bennett, Malcolm J.|Kaeppler, Shawn M.|Brown, Kathleen M.|Bhosale, Rahul|Lynch, Jonathan P.

Cellular sugar starvation and/or energy deprivation serves as an important signaling cue for the live cells to trigger the necessary stress adaptation response. When exposed to cellular energy stress (ES) conditions, the plants reconfigure metabolic pathways and rebalance energy status while restricting vegetative organ growth. Despite the vital importance of this ES-induced growth restriction, the regulatory mechanism underlying the response remains largely elusive in plants.

Optimization of metabolically engineered organisms requires good understanding of producing balanced level of pathway proteins. Targeted proteomics via selected-reaction monitoring (SRM) has been increasingly used in metabolic engineering studies to detect and quantify sets of proteins with high selectivity, multiplexity, and reproducibility. In combination with metabolomics and other omics tools, targeted proteomics has helped optimize the production of many bio-based chemicals in various metabolic engineering cell factories. In this review, we present recent applications of targeted proteomics in metabolic engineering studies and highlight several successful cases of targeted proteomics in boosting production of commodity and high value chemicals. Additionally, we also discuss challenges and limitations of current targeted proteomics and map opportunities for future research.

In this report, we systematically characterize 32 response regulators (RRs) from a metal tolerant groundwater isolate, Pseudomonas stutzeri RCH2 to assess the impact of host-derived post-translational phosphorylation. As observed by distinct shifted bands in a phos-tag gel, 12 of the 24 detected RRs show homogenous mixtures of phosphorylated proteins or heterogenous mixtures of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins. By evaluating the phosphorylation state of CzcR and CopR II under varying assay parameters, we found that changes to pH and exogenous addition of phospho-donors (e.g. acetyl phosphate) have little to no effect on phosphorylation state. By applying protein production conditions that decrease the pool of intracellular acetyl-phosphate in E. coli, we found a reduction in the phosphorylated population of CopR II when magnesium was added to the medium, but observed no change in phosphorylated population when CopR II is expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Δpta, a mutant with a metabolic disruption to the acetyl-phosphate pathway. Therefore, the specific mechanism of post-translational phosphorylation of RRs in E. coli remains obscure. These findings show the importance of characterizing the phosphorylation state of proteins when heterologously expressed, since their biochemical and physiological properties can be dependent on post-translational modification.

The majority of primary and secondary metabolites in nature have yet to be identified, representing a major challenge for metabolomics studies that currently require reference libraries from analyses of authentic compounds. Using currently available analytical methods, complete chemical characterization of metabolomes is infeasible for both technical and economic reasons. For example, unambiguous identification of metabolites is limited by the availability of authentic chemical standards, which, for the majority of molecules, do not exist. Computationally predicted or calculated data are a viable solution to expand the currently limited metabolite reference libraries, if such methods are shown to be sufficiently accurate. For example, determining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy spectra in silico has shown promise in the identification and delineation of metabolite structures. Many researchers have been taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT), a computationally inexpensive yet reputable method for the prediction of carbon and proton NMR spectra of metabolites. However, such methods are expected to have some error in predicted <sup>13</sup>>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra with respect to experimentally measured values. This leads us to the question–what accuracy is required in predicted <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shifts for confident metabolite identification? Using the set of 11,716 small molecules found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), we simulated both experimental and theoretical NMR chemical shift databases. We investigated the level of accuracy required for identification of metabolites in simulated pure and impure samples by matching predicted chemical shifts to experimental data. We found 90% or more of molecules in simulated pure samples can be successfully identified when errors of <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts in water are below 0.6 and 7.1 ppm, respectively, and below 0.5 and 4.6 ppm in chloroform solvation, respectively. In simulated complex mixtures, as the complexity of the mixture increased, greater accuracy of the calculated chemical shifts was required, as expected. However, if the number of molecules in the mixture is known, e.g., when NMR is combined with MS and sample complexity is low, the likelihood of confident molecular identification increased by 90%.

Over the last 25 years, biology has entered the genomic era and is becoming a science of ‘big data’. Most interpretations of genomic analyses rely on accurate functional annotations of the proteins encoded by more than 500 000 genomes sequenced to date. By different estimates, only half the predicted sequenced proteins carry an accurate functional annotation, and this percentage varies drastically between different organismal lineages. Such a large gap in knowledge hampers all aspects of biological enterprise and, thereby, is standing in the way of genomic biology reaching its full potential. A brainstorming meeting to address this issue funded by the National Science Foundation was held during 3–4 February 2022. Bringing together data scientists, biocurators, computational biologists and experimentalists within the same venue allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the current state of functional annotations of protein families.

<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  Genetic code expansion technology allows for the use of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) to create semisynthetic organisms for both biochemical and biomedical applications. However, exogenous feeding of chemically synthesized ncAAs at high concentrations is required to compensate for the inefficient cellular uptake and incorporation of these components into proteins, especially in the case of eukaryotic cells and multicellular organisms. To generate organisms capable of autonomously biosynthesizing an ncAA and incorporating it into proteins, we have engineered a metabolic pathway for the synthesis of  <italic>O</italic>  ‐methyltyrosine (OMeY). Specifically, we endowed organisms with a marformycins biosynthetic pathway‐derived methyltransferase that efficiently converts tyrosine to OMeY in the presence of the co‐factor  <italic>S</italic>  ‐adenosylmethionine. The resulting cells can produce and site‐specifically incorporate OMeY into proteins at much higher levels than cells exogenously fed OMeY. To understand the structural basis for the substrate selectivity of the transferase, we solved the X‐ray crystal structures of the ligand‐free and tyrosine‐bound enzymes. Most importantly, we have extended this OMeY biosynthetic system to both mammalian cells and the zebrafish model to enhance the utility of genetic code expansion. The creation of autonomous eukaryotes using a 21st amino acid will make genetic code expansion technology more applicable to multicellular organisms, providing valuable vertebrate models for biological and biomedical research.  </p>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4443		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d3c		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890007		1890007	Protein Science	Journal Article			Expanding the eukaryotic genetic code with a biosynthesized 21st amino acid									
<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Metabolites, or the small organic molecules that are synthesized by cells during metabolism, comprise a complex and dynamic pool of carbon in the ocean. They are an essential currency in interactions at the population and community levels of biological organization. Characterizing metabolite distributions inside microbial cells and dissolved in seawater is essential to understanding the controls on their production and fate, as well as their roles in shaping marine microbial food webs. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics method to quantify particulate and dissolved distributions of a suite of biologically relevant metabolites including vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, osmolytes, and intermediates in biosynthetic pathways along a latitudinal transect in the western Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in the upper 200 m of the water column, most particulate or intracellular metabolites positively covary with the most abundant microbial taxa. In contrast, dissolved metabolites exhibited greater variability with differences in distribution between ocean regions. Although fewer particulate metabolites were detected below 200 m, the particulate metabolites identified in the deep ocean may be linked to adaptive physiological strategies of deep‐sea microbes. Based on the identified metabolite distributions, we propose relationships between certain metabolites and microbial populations, and find that dissolved metabolite distributions are not directly related to their particulate abundances.</p>	Johnson, Winifred M.

<title>Abstract</title>  <sec>  <title>Background</title>  <p>Developing economically viable pathways to produce renewable energy has become an important research theme in recent years. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock that can be converted into second-generation biofuels and bioproducts. Global warming has adversely affected climate change causing many environmental changes that have impacted earth surface temperature and rainfall patterns. Recent research has shown that environmental growth conditions altered the composition of drought-stressed switchgrass and directly influenced the extent of biomass conversion to fuels by completely inhibiting yeast growth during fermentation. Our goal in this project was to find a way to overcome the microbial inhibition and characterize specific compounds that led to this inhibition. Additionally, we also determined if these microbial inhibitors were plant-generated compounds, by-products of the pretreatment process, or a combination of both.</p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>Results</title>  <p>  Switchgrass harvested in drought (2012) and non-drought (2010) years were pretreated using Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX). Untreated and AFEX processed samples were then extracted using solvents (i.e., water, ethanol, and ethyl acetate) to selectively remove potential inhibitory compounds and determine whether pretreatment affects the inhibition. High solids loading enzymatic hydrolysis was performed on all samples, followed by fermentation using engineered  <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>  . Fermentation rate, cell growth, sugar consumption, and ethanol production were used to evaluate fermentation performance. We found that water extraction of drought-year switchgrass before AFEX pretreatment reduced the inhibition of yeast fermentation. The extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) to detect compounds enriched in the extracted fractions. Saponins, a class of plant-generated triterpene or steroidal glycosides, were found to be significantly more abundant in the water extracts from drought-year (inhibitory) switchgrass. The inhibitory nature of the saponins in switchgrass hydrolysate was validated by spiking commercially available saponin standard (protodioscin) in non-inhibitory switchgrass hydrolysate harvested in normal year.  </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>Conclusions</title>  <p>Adding a water extraction step prior to AFEX-pretreatment of drought-stressed switchgrass effectively overcame inhibition of yeast growth during bioethanol production. Saponins appear to be generated by the plant as a response to drought as they were significantly more abundant in the drought-stressed switchgrass water extracts and may contribute toward yeast inhibition in drought-stressed switchgrass hydrolysates.</p>  </sec>						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-022-02213-y		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5d3e		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1895540		1895540	Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts	Journal Article			Water-soluble saponins accumulate in drought-stressed switchgrass and may inhibit yeast growth during bioethanol production									
Nε-lysine acetylation is a common posttranslational modification observed in diverse species of bacteria. Aside from a few central metabolic enzymes and transcription factors, little is known about how this posttranslational modification regulates protein activity. In this work, we investigated how lysine acetylation affects translation in Escherichia coli. In multiple species of bacteria, ribosomal proteins are highly acetylated at conserved lysine residues, suggesting that this modification may regulate translation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the addition of either of the acetyl donors acetyl phosphate and acetyl-coenzyme A inhibits translation but not transcription using an E. coli cell-free system. Further investigations using in vivo assays revealed that acetylation does not appear to alter the rate of translation elongation but, rather, increases the proportions of dissociated 30S and 50S ribosomes, based on polysome profiles of mutants or growth conditions known to promote lysine acetylation. Furthermore, ribosomal proteins are more acetylated in the disassociated 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits than in the fully assembled 70S complex. The effect of acetylation is also growth rate dependent, with disassociation of the subunits being most pronounced during late-exponential and early-stationary-phase growth—the same growth phase where protein acetylation is greatest. Collectively, our data demonstrate that lysine acetylation inhibits translation, most likely by interfering with subunit association. These results have also uncovered a new mechanism for coupling translation to the metabolic state of the cell.

We report Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a well-studied bacterium for the conversion of lignin-derived aromatic compounds to bioproducts. The development of advanced genetic tools in P. putida has reduced the turnaround time for hypothesis testing and enabled the construction of strains capable of producing various products of interest. Here, we evaluate an inducible CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) toolset on fluorescent, essential, and metabolic targets. Nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) expressed with the arabinose (8K)-inducible promoter was shown to be tightly regulated across various media conditions and when targeting essential genes. In addition to bulk growth data, single cell time lapse microscopy was conducted, which revealed intrinsic heterogeneity in knockdown rate within an isoclonal population. The dynamics of knockdown were studied across genomic targets in exponentially-growing cells, revealing a universal 1.75 ± 0.38 hour quiescent phase after induction where 1.5 ± 0.35 doublings occur before a phenotypic response is observed. To demonstrate application of this CRISPRi toolset, β-ketoadipate, a monomer for performance-advantaged nylon, was produced at a 4.39 ± 0.5 g/L and yield of 0.76 ± 0.10 mol/mol from p-coumarate, a hydroxycinnamic acid that can be derived from grasses. These cultivation metrics were achieved by using the higher strength IPTG (1K)-inducible promoter to knockdown the pcaIJ operon in the βKA pathway during early exponential phase. This allowed the majority of the carbon to be shunted into the desired product while eliminating the need for a supplemental carbon and energy source to support growth and maintenance.

Cytochrome P450 system consists of P450 monooxygenase and redox pattern(s). While the importance of monooxygenases in plant metabolism is well documented, the metabolic roles of the related redox components have been largely overlooked. Here, we show that distinct electron transfer chains are recruited in phenylpropanoid-monolignol P450 systems to support the synthesis of different classes of phenolics in different plant tissues. While Arabidopsis cinnamate 4-hydroxylase adopts conventional NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) electron transfer chain for its para-hydroxylation, ferulate 5-hydroxylase employs both NADPH-CPR cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> (CB5) and NADH-cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase (CBR)-CB5 chains to support benzene ring 5-hydroxylation. Moreover, the former route is primarily recruited in the stem for syringyl lignin synthesis, while the latter dominates in the syntheses of 5-hydroxylated phenolics in seeds and seed coat suberin. The availability of reductants NADPH and NADH and the catalytic properties of both reductases to CB5 contribute to the tissue-preferential recruitment of electron transfer systems. Our study unveils an additional layer of complexity and versatility of P450 system that the higher plants evolved for diversifying phenolic repertoires.

Heterologous production of limonene in microorganisms through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway has traditionally imposed metabolic burden and reduced cell fitness, where imbalanced stoichiometries among sequential enzymes result in the accumulation of toxic intermediates. Although prior studies have shown that changes to mRNA stability, RBS strength, and protein homology can be effective strategies for balancing enzyme levels in the MVA pathway, testing different variations of these parameters often requires distinct genetic constructs, which can exponentially increase assembly costs as pathways increase in size. Here, we developed a multi-input transcriptional circuit to regulate the MVA pathway, where four chemical inducers, L-arabinose (Ara), choline chloride (Cho), cuminic acid (Cuma), and isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), each regulate one of four orthogonal promoters. We tested modular transcriptional regulation of the MVA pathway by placing this circuit in an engineered Escherichia coli “marionette” strain, which enabled systematic and independent tuning of the first three enzymes (AtoB, HMGS, and HMGR) in the MVA pathway. By systematically testing combinations of chemical inducers as inputs, we investigated relationships between the expressions of different MVA pathway submodules, finding that limonene yields are sensitive to the coordinated transcriptional regulation of HMGS and HMGR.

Assessing the structure of living microbial cell membranes is a challenging analytical goal. The cell membrane is defined by its transverse structure, an approximately 5 nm-thick selectively permeable bilayer that serves many important cellular functions. Compositionally complex, dynamic, and organized in both the transverse and lateral dimensions, understanding the cell membrane structure - and the role that structure plays in cellular function, communication, and environmental sensing is an active scientific effort. Previously, we have devised a novel isotopic labeling approach for membrane lipids to enable direct in vivo structural studies of the cell membrane in the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, using small-angle neutron scattering. This was accomplished through a genetic inhibition of fatty acid (FA) degradation (ΔfadN) and a chemical inhibition of FA biosynthesis using cerulenin, an irreversible inhibitor of type II fatty acid synthases. Here, we improve upon the previous system by introducing a dCas9/sgRNA-fabF complex that blocks transcription of the essential fabF gene when under xylose induction. This leads to greater sensitivity to cerulenin in the mutant strain (JEBS102) and more robust cell growth when supplementary FAs are introduced to the culture medium. A subtle change in FA uptake is noted when compared to the prior labeling strategy. This is seen in the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data as a higher ratio of >n16:0 to a15:0, and manifests in an apparent increase in the membrane thickness determined via neutron scattering. This represents an improved method of isotopic labeling for the cell membrane of Bacillus subtilis; enabling improved investigations of cellular uptake and utilization of FAs, cell membrane structure and organization as a phenotypic response to metabolic and environmental changes.

The severity of the cancer statistics around the globe and the complexity involving the behavior of cancer cells inevitably calls for contributions from multidisciplinary areas of research. As such, materials science became a powerful asset to support biological research in comprehending the macro and microscopic behavior of cancer cells and untangling factors that may contribute to their progression or remission. The contributions of cellular water dynamics in this process have always been debated and, in recent years, experimental works performed with Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) brought new perspectives to these discussions. In this review, we address these works and highlight the value of QENS in comprehending the role played by water molecules in tumor cells and their response to external agents, particularly chemotherapy drugs. In addition, this paper provides an overview of QENS intended for scientists with different backgrounds and comments on the possibilities to be explored with the next-generation spectrometers under construction.

The lives of microbes unfold at the micron scale, and their molecular machineries operate at the nanoscale. Their study at these resolutions is key towards achieving a better understanding of their ecology. We focus on cellulose degradation of the canonical Clostridium thermocellum system to comprehend how microbes build and use their cellulosomal machinery at these nanometer scales. Degradation of cellulose, the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, is instrumental to the global carbon cycle. We reveal that bacterial cells form 'cellulosome capsules' driven by catalytic product-dependent dynamics, which can increase the rate of hydrolysis. Biosynthesis of this energetically costly machinery and cell growth are decoupled at the single-cell level, hinting at a division-of-labor strategy through phenotypic heterogeneity. This novel observation highlights intra-population interactions as key to understanding rates of fiber degradation.						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76523		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5e06		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870525		1870525	eLife	Journal Article			Nanoscale Resolution of Microbial Fiber Degradation in Action									
Background: In Antarctica, summer sunlight enables phototrophic microorganisms to drive primary production, thereby “feeding” ecosystems to enable their persistence through the long, dark winter months. In Ace Lake, a stratified marine-derived system in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica, a Chlorobium species of green sulphur bacteria (GSB) is the dominant phototroph, although its seasonal abundance changes more than 100-fold. Here, we analysed 413 Gb of Antarctic metagenome data including 59 Chlorobium metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Ace Lake and nearby stratified marine basins to determine how genome variation and population structure across a 7-year period impacted ecosystem function. Results: A single species, Candidatus Chlorobium antarcticum (most similar to Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM265) prevails in all three aquatic systems and harbours very little genomic variation (≥ 99% average nucleotide identity). A notable feature of variation that did exist related to the genomic capacity to biosynthesize cobalamin. The abundance of phylotypes with this capacity changed seasonally ~ 2-fold, consistent with the population balancing the value of a bolstered photosynthetic capacity in summer against an energetic cost in winter. The very high GSB concentration (> 10<sup>8</sup> cells ml<sup>–1</sup> in Ace Lake) and seasonal cycle of cell lysis likely make Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum a major provider of cobalamin to the food web. Analysis of Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum viruses revealed the species to be infected by generalist (rather than specialist) viruses with a broad host range (e.g., infecting Gammaproteobacteria) that were present in diverse Antarctic lakes. The marked seasonal decrease in Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum abundance may restrict specialist viruses from establishing effective lifecycles, whereas generalist viruses may augment their proliferation using other hosts. Conclusion: The factors shaping Antarctic microbial communities are gradually being defined. In addition to the cold, the annual variation in sunlight hours dictates which phototrophic species can grow and the extent to which they contribute to ecosystem processes. The Chlorobium population studied was inferred to provide cobalamin, in addition to carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur cycling, as critical ecosystem services. The specific Antarctic environmental factors and major ecosystem benefits afforded by this GSB likely explain why such a coherent population structure has developed in this Chlorobium species.

Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain proteins belong to a superfamily of coiled-coil proteins influencing membrane curvature in eukaryotes and are associated with vesicle biogenesis, vesicle-mediated protein trafficking, and intracellular signaling. Here, we report a bacterial protein with BAR domain-like activity, BdpA, from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, known to produce redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer-scale outer membrane extensions (OMEs). BdpA is required for uniform size distribution of membrane vesicles and influences scaffolding of OMEs into a consistent diameter and curvature. Cryo-TEM reveals that a strain lacking BdpA produces lobed, disordered OMEs rather than membrane tubules or narrow chains produced by the wild-type strain. Overexpression of BdpA promotes OME formation during planktonic growth of S. oneidensis where they are not typically observed. Heterologous expression results in OME production in Marinobacter atlanticus and Escherichia coli. Based on the ability of BdpA to alter membrane architecture in vivo, we propose that BdpA and its homologs comprise a newly identified class of bacterial BAR domain-like proteins.

Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a well-studied iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophilic chemolithoautotroph that is exploited for its ability to participate in the bioleaching of metal sulfides. Here, we overexpressed the endogenous glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase genes in separate strains and found that glutathione synthetase overexpression increased intracellular glutathione levels. We explored the impact of pH on the halotolerance of iron oxidation in wild-type and engineered cultures. The increase in glutathione allowed the modified cells to grow under salt concentrations and pH conditions that are fully inhibitory to wild-type cells. Furthermore, we found that improved iron oxidation ability in the presence of chloride also resulted in higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the strain. These results indicate that glutathione overexpression can be used to increase halotolerance in A. ferrooxidans and would likely be a useful strategy on other acidophilic bacteria.

Methanogens have a high demand for iron (Fe) and sulfur (S); however, little is known of how they acquire, deploy, and store these elements and how this, in turn, affects their physiology. Methanogens were recently shown to reduce pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) generating aqueous iron-sulfide (FeS<sub>(aq)</sub>) clusters that are likely assimilated as a source of Fe and S. Here, we compare the phenotype of <em>Methanococcus voltae</em> when grown with FeS<sub>2</sub> or ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and sulfide (HS<sup>-</sup>). FeS<sub>2</sub>-grown cells are 33% smaller yet have 193% more Fe than Fe(II)/HS<sup>-</sup>-grown cells. Whole cell EPR revealed similar distributions of paramagnetic Fe, although FeS<sub>2</sub>-grown cells showed a broad spectral feature attributed to intracellular thioferrate-like nanoparticles. Differential proteomic analyses showed similar expression of core methanogenesis enzymes, indicating that Fe and S source does not substantively alter the energy metabolism of cells. However, a homolog of the Fe(II) transporter FeoB and its putative transcriptional regulator DtxR were up-expressed in FeS<sub>2</sub>-grown cells, suggesting that cells sense Fe(II) limitation. Two homologs of IssA, a protein putatively involved in coordinating thioferrate nanoparticles, were also up-expressed in FeS<sub>2</sub>-grown cells. We interpret these data to indicate that, in FeS<sub>2</sub>-grown cells, DtxR cannot sense Fe(II) and therefore cannot down-regulate FeoB. We suggest this is due to the transport of Fe(II) complexed with sulfide (FeS<sub>(aq)</sub>) leading to excess Fe that is sequestered by IssA as a thioferrate-like species. This model provides a framework for the design of targeted experiments aimed at further characterizing Fe acquisition and homeostasis in <em>M. voltae</em> and other methanogens.

Optimizing the metabolism of microbial cell factories for yields and titers is a critical step for economically viable production of bioproducts and biofuels. In this process, tuning the expression of individual enzymes to obtain the desired pathway flux is a challenging step, in which data from separate multiomics techniques must be integrated with existing biological knowledge to determine where changes should be made. Following a design-build-test-learn strategy, building on recent advances in Bayesian metabolic control analysis, we identify in this work key enzymes in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica that correlate with the production of itaconate by integrating a metabolic model with multiomics measurements. To this extent, we quantify the uncertainty for a variety of key parameters, known as flux control coefficients (FCCs), needed to improve the bioproduction of target metabolites and statistically obtain key correlations between the measured enzymes and boundary flux. Based on the top five significant FCCs and five correlated enzymes, our results show phosphoglycerate mutase, acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSm), carbonic anhydrase (HCO3E), pyrophosphatase (PPAm), and homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDxi) enzymes in rate-limiting reactions that can lead to increased itaconic acid production.

Soil microbiomes harbour unparalleled functional and phylogenetic diversity. However, extracting isolates with a targeted function from complex microbiomes is not straightforward, particularly if the associated phenotype does not lend itself to high-throughput screening. Here, we tackle the methylation of arsenic (As) in anoxic soils. As methylation was proposed to be catalysed by sulfate-reducing bacteria. However, to date, there are no available anaerobic isolates capable of As methylation, whether sulfate-reducing or otherwise. The isolation of such a microorganism has been thwarted by the fact that the anaerobic bacteria harbouring a functional arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) tested to date did not methylate As in pure culture. Additionally, fortuitous As methylation can result from the release of non-specific methyltransferases upon lysis. Thus, we combined metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics to identify the microorganisms actively methylating As in anoxic soil-derived microbial cultures. Based on the metagenome-assembled genomes of microorganisms expressing ArsM, we isolated Paraclostridium sp. strain EML, which was confirmed to actively methylate As anaerobically. This work is an example of the application of meta-omics to the isolation of elusive microorganisms.						e5e1bf6c-da8c-40fe-ac5a-d63df045a0f5	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-022-01220-z		668da8e4393fbc602a7f5e0c		https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1883770		1883770	The ISME Journal	Journal Article			Meta-omics-aided isolation of an elusive anaerobic arsenic-methylating soil bacterium
