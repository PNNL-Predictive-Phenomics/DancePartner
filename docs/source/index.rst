Welcome to DancePartner!
########################

*DancePartner* is a python package for mining multi-omics relationship networks from literature and databases.
Though *DancePartner* may be organized into an intuitive pipeline, it should be thought of as a toolbox of 
functions for building multi-omics networks for various needs, whether those be networks derived only from literature,
databases, or a mix of the two. We welcome additions to our package and are happy to collaborate with anyone willing 
to add code to this framework. For simplicity, we will present the code in three different pipelines: 

`A. Mining from Literature`_

`B. Mining from Databases`_

`C. Building & Combining Networks`_

#########################
A. Mining from Literature
#########################

The literature mining pipeline may be summarized in ? key steps: `1. Pulling Publications`_, `2. Identifying Entities`_,
`3. Extracting Relationships`_, `4. Collapsing Synonyms`_, and `5. Building Networks`_.

***********************
1. Pulling Publications
***********************

Publications may be pulled from any of three databases: `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_, `Scopus <https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic>`_,
and `OSTI <https://www.osti.gov/>`_.
